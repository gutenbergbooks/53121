<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>


<p>Not only among laymen but also among serious thinkers
and writers on medical topics the opinion is generally prevalent,
that there is a vast difference in the degree of intensity of the
sex-impulse in men and women. Upon this supposition rests
the justification of the double standard of sexual morality of
the two sexes. If the intensity of the amatory emotions is the
same in both sexes, then there is no justification for a double
standard of sexual morality.</p>

<p>Now, an emotion is, in its nature, subjective. Its intensity
can never be objectively determined. Men and women may
dispute the question of the different degree of intensity of the
amatory emotions till the end of time, still they will never
reach a definite conclusion. The only way to determine the
nature of an emotion is to study its pathology. If it can be
shown that the same pathological entities of the sex-instinct
are found in men and women, the inference is justified that
the normal emotions are also the same or similar in both sexes.</p>

<p>To prove the similarity or identity of the intensity of the
sex-impulse in both sexes, the author published in the winter of
1906-1907 his book “Woman, A Treatise on the Normal and
Pathological Emotions of Feminine Love.” Since the publication
of “Woman” he received numerous letters with requests to write
a similar treatise on the amatory emotions of men. In 1910
the author published “Genesis, A Manual for the Instruction of
Children in Matters Sexual.” He thought that the Description
of the evolution of sex in plant and animal in “Genesis” might
supply the demand. Still the requests continued to arrive.
He then published, in 1912, “Neurasthenia Sexualis, A Treatise
on Sexual Impotence in Men and Women.” In this treatise the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
anatomy and physiology of the male organs of generation were
thoroughly discussed. Still it did not fill the demand. The
chapter on pathology dealt only with impotence.</p>

<p>When the author finally decided to write the counterpart
of “Woman”, it occurred to him that if the amatory emotions
are the same in men and women, they ought to be treated together
in one volume. Hence the present work “Love, A Treatise
on the Science of Sex-Attraction.” Naturally the present volume
recapitulates all that the author has previously written in his
three books, “Woman,” “Genesis,” and “Neurasthenia Sexualis.”
The three previous works are mere chapters of the present
treatise. Still every author grows with his work. After years
of study of the subject of sex, he was able to expand the sphere
of his previous lessons, so that even those readers who have read
his three previous books will still find some new points in this
work. If the readers should agree with this opinion, the author
will consider himself well paid for his labors.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_SECOND_EDITION">PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>


<p>The main criticism of “Love” by the reviewers of the first
edition was directed against the frequency of Latin words and
phrases used in veiling some of the more unpleasant aspects of
the normal and especially the pathological sex-activities.</p>

<p>Still it was not prudery which dictated this course. The
ancient language was used as a protection against the criticism
of those who would take umbrage to plain sex expressions.
There is quite a number of people who are not only possessed
of the Oedipus complex or the Electra complex, but who are
also obsessed of the obscenity complex. For the impure everything
is impure. Fortunately such people’s knowledge of Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
is, as a rule, very slight, and for them this treatise will remain
a sealed book. Physicians and lawyers for whom this book was
written know enough Latin grammar, enabling them to apprehend
the meaning of all those phrases necessary for the understanding
of the main points of the treatise. To facilitate the
reader’s task the following vocabulary of the Latin words often
used has been appended.</p>

<h2><a id="PART_I"></a>PART I.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>Two intense desires rule and govern mankind and control
all man’s thoughts, his joys and sorrows. They are man’s two
appetites, hunger for food and craving for love. Curiously
enough, while man takes great pains in the education of the
young to prepare them for the gratification of hunger, the much
tabooed question of sex has been excluded, in our present civilization,
from every discussion.</p>

<p>Yet love lies at the foundation of society, it permeates unconsciously
the thoughts, aspirations and hopes of mankind.
Love is glorified as the source of the most admirable productions
of art, of the sublime creations of poetry and music; it is accepted
as the mightiest factor in human civilization, as the basis of the
family and state. The egoism of passion and the power of love
are absorbing all other considerations. Virgil calls love the
greatest conqueror:</p>

<p class="center">“Omnia vincit amor, nos et cedamus amori.”</p>

<p>Solomon sings, “Love is strong as death.”</p>

<p>In its right appreciation, love has been exalted by the
ancients in song and story and extolled by priest and philosopher.
“To the Spirit, to Heaven, to the Sun, to the Moon, to Earth,
to Night, to the Day, and to the Father of all that is and will
be, to Eros.” Such an invocation was possible only among the
ancient civilized nations. They recognized the importance of
sexuality in life. They could not see any moral turpitude in
actions, regarded by them as the design of nature and as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
acme of felicity. They discovered in Love the focus of life.
For this reason sexuality among the ancients was an object of
pure reverence as the fundamental force of life. The divine
adoration of sex was the practice of every tribe and nation of
prehistoric antiquity. Even the organs of sex were considered
beautiful and pleasurable objects, and were admired accordingly.
The phallus, or the male sex-organ, and the yoni, the external
female genitals, were symbols of the worship of the ancients
and were objects of special religious rites.</p>

<p>In the remotest antiquity the worship of the generative principle
was the only religion known to men. Sex-worship was not
confined to any one race. It was the form of worship common
to all primeval nations of the globe. The Hindus, Chaldeans,
Hebrews, Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Gauls, Celts, Teutons,
Britons and Scandinavians, all shared in phallicism and yonism.</p>

<p>The study of sexual activities and of generation was the
basis of ancient Hindu theology. Siva had on his left arm a
ring on which was portrayed the sex organs in the act of procreation.
The Greek bacchanalia, and the Roman saturnalian
mysteries, the free love that prevailed during the festivities in
honor of Mylitta, Anaitis, and Aphrodita were still relics of sex-worship.
Herodotos’ statement that in Babylon women offered
themselves, once at least in their lives, in the Temple of Venus,
and that only after so doing were they considered free to marry,
and his further report that the women on the vessels sailing for
Bubastis to the festivals of Iris uncovered themselves in the
presence of the men, show that sex-worship was not unknown
among Assyrians and Egyptians.</p>

<p>In the historic time sex worship was almost replaced by
other forms of religion. Yet there are traces of the cult of the
phallus to be found everywhere in ancient profane and sacred
history. The temple in which the emperor Elgabal was brought
up was represented on a bronze coin of his reign; an ionic
peristyle with a peek into the Cella, but instead of the statue
of a god was a gigantic phallus. Even the Hebrews worshipped
in the phallus the principle of the production of life before the
adoption of the cult of Jehovah. Records of phallicism can
still be found in the Old Testament. Instead of invoking the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Deity in taking a solemn oath, Abraham orders his servant to
place his hand upon his phallus, because the phallus was still
kept in its former high veneration. The slain enemy was, for
this reason, deprived of his phallus. David bought Saul’s daughter
with a trophy of two hundred phalli, taken from the slain
Philistines. Circumcision also shows the incorporation of phallic
ritual with religion.</p>

<p>In the same light and with the same veneration as the
phallus was the yoni worshipped. In the yoni was worshipped
the receptacle of life, the divine ark, within the hidden enclosure
of which was contained the mystery of life. Its interior
was considered the holy of holies. The yoni was for that reason
often represented by an ark, which was the holiest of all symbols
in the worship of the Ancients. The worship of Osiris took place
before an ark; the sanctum sanctorum of Jehovah’s temple harbored
an ark.</p>

<p>Yonism was the adoration of the vulva, as the organ through
which the sexual powers are manifested. It is through the
woman that the divine sexual emotions are aroused; it is the
sight or thought of her that calls into activity the man’s generative
nature and powers.</p>

<p>The female principle in nature was hence not considered
simply as a passive medium, but was exalted and worshipped
as a potent factor in the mystery of creation and reproduction.
The earth itself was considered feminine, and all natural orifices
have been regarded as typical of that part which characterizes
woman. The vulva, therefore, was the sacred symbol of the
female principle in nature.</p>

<p>The Ashereh, so often mentioned in the Bible, was nothing
but the image of the yoni. It was a symbol of Ashtoreth, or of
the union of Baal and Ashtoreth. The Ashereh was made of
wood and had in its centre an opening or fissure as the door of
life. Above the fissure was a small elevation as an emblematical
representation of the clitoris.</p>

<p>The most common forms of the feminine symbol were those
made in representation of the mons Veneris. The mountain of
Venus was represented by mounds, columns and pyramids.
Mounds and hills were considered holy. The graves of Egyp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>tian
kings were erected in form of huge pyramids in honor of
the feminine creative deity. The yoni worshippers of the Old
Testament had the temples of their feminine deity on high hills.
The obelisk, pillar, column, altar, mount and cave, all have their
origin in the pristine symbolism of yonic worship.</p>

<p>Even the present belief in the lucky horseshoe is connected
with the ancient emblems of the female genitals, the yoni. In
Ireland the yoni seem to have been the symbol of sex-worship
most in use. Even in the arches over the doorways of Christian
churches a female figure, with the person fully exposed, was so
placed that the external organs of generation at once caught
the eye. In olden times, the people were in the habit of making
charcoal drawings of the female genitals over the doors of their
houses to ward off ill luck. Now, the horseshoe has a great resemblance
with the form of the vulva. Hence the drawings over
the doors resembled a horseshoe. From this symbol originates
the horseshoe’s alleged power to ward off evil and to bring luck.
Father Dubois found that the lingam which the devout Hindus
attach either to their hair or arms or is suspended from the
neck is a small amulet representing the organs of both sexes in
activity. Even the symbol of the cross has been identified with
the earliest records of sex-worship. The cruciform symbol on
the Assyrian relics and in the temples of Vishnu typifies the
sacredness of Love’s physical expression.</p>

<p>Thus with the ancients the passion of sex and the fervor
of religion were closely interwoven. Accordingly every ancient
temple had within its confines a number of consecrated women
whose office it was to submit to the embraces of any man upon
the payment of a specified sum. The money was used for religious
purposes. To the mind of the Ancients no more appropriate
nor holy means could be devised for raising money for
the maintenance of the temple than a sanctified indulgence in
the divine act. It was the most sacred and sublime of all human
functions. Hence the temple-courtesan was held in high honor
and was considered as sacred as the priest. The Old Testament
calls the temple-courtesan “Hakdeshoh,” the consecrated, the
holy; and it was not in the least degrading to associate with her,
in the early history of the Hebrews, as the story of Juda and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
Tamar shows. Later on, Amos (ii, 7) complains that the Hebrew
maidens received the embraces of men at every altar.
Hosea (iv, 14) distinguishes between the common prostitute
and the temple-courtesan.</p>

<p>The lapse of Israel into the former sex-worship, at the time
of these prophets, caused a reaction against any sex-manifestations.
This reaction is especially noticeable among the faithful
adherents of the religion of Jehovah in the latter days of the
second temple. The pious men sought the greatest virtue in
chastity and celibacy and looked with contempt upon sexuality.
In the beginning only individual persons took to celibacy, as
did Elijah and Elisha. Later on these celibates became more
numerous and formed different orders, of which the order of the
Essaeans was the most important, because Christianity took its
origin within the folds of this order.</p>

<p>In accordance with its origin, Christianity never looked with
favor upon sexuality of any kind. The immaculate virgin is
the ideal. Even holy matrimony was only tolerated. “It is
good for a man not to touch a woman,” writes Paul to the
Corinthians (Cap. vii). Christianity, therefore, always surrounded
with a halo those who vowed chastity. To overcome
the passion of sex was always praised as the highest virtue, and
asceticism was held in high veneration. Justinus says that total
sexual abstinence is a high virtue, and that sexual activity is
unnecessary to life. Hieronymus claims that God and the
Church requested singleness and only permitted marriage.
Christianity entirely overlooked the tremendous strain upon the
physical, mental and moral forces such an unnatural life must
carry with it. For though complete abstinence is possible and
feasible during the period of adolescence, men and women, when
mature in years, suffer under such enforced abstinence, and although
the final act, or the culmination of the sex-attraction,
may be suppressed by the will, yet its emotions are irresistible.
The neurotic nun who imagines herself being embraced by a
saint thinks that she has subjugated the instinct of sex, but in
reality her emotions have a sexual origin.</p>

<p>Actions caused by great sexual excitement may be found
in the life of many a saint. Augustinus, in his confessions, says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
“My heart was burning, boiling and foaming with unchastity;
it was poured out, it overflowed, it went up in licentiousness.”</p>

<p>Origines found sexual abstinence too difficult and castrated
himself. For that reason he never was canonized. For the
spirit should kill the flesh. Parkman’s report about Marie de
l’Incarnation is highly interesting in this respect. She heard,
while in a trance, a miraculous voice, Christ promising to become
her spouse. Months and years passed, when again the
voice sounded in her ear, this time with the assurance that the
promise was fulfilled, that she was indeed his bride. Now ensued
phenomena which are not infrequent among female devotees,
when unmarried or married unhappily. In her excited imagination,
the divine spouse became a living presence, and her language
to him, as recorded by herself, is of intense passion. Her
prayer is, “O! my Love! when shall I embrace you? Have you
no pity on the torments which I suffer? Alas, alas, my Love,
my Beauty, my Life! Instead of healing my pain you take
pleasure in it. Come, let me embrace you and die in your sacred
arms.”</p>

<p>A curious instance of perversion in religio-sexual feeling,
bordering on zoöerastia, is the case of St. Veronica. According
to Friedrich she was so enamored of the divine lion, symbolizing
St. Mark, that she took a lion whelp to her bed, fondled it, kissed
it “et præbebat ei mammas.”</p>

<p>Thus the preaching of the Church on the subjugation of
the flesh was no great success even among the saints. If the
ascetics are not frigid they remain subject to the emotions of
sex. Mankind at large is surely ruled by the dictates of the
sex-urge, in our day no less than at the time of sex-worship.
Especially do all feminine thoughts, aspirations and pursuits
aim, though sometimes unconsciously, at love, in spite of our
false modesty, prudery and conspiracy of silence about the
fundamental facts of reproduction.</p>

<p>One glance at the fashions in dress will bear out this contention.
The question of dress surely rules the thoughts and
actions of a majority of our modern women. Now what is the
meaning of dress? Grosse in his “Anfänge der Kunst” shows
that the desire for clothes was originally an irradiation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
sex instinct. The man adopted dress for the purpose of decoration,
the woman for the purpose of attraction through covering.
The first coverings of the private parts served as an ornament
of the same and to render the parts covered more conspicuous.
For where nudity generally prevails, the practice of covering
certain parts of the body excites curiosity and solicits the observation
of the other sex. Mortimer reports that in Australia
girls cast off their aprons after marriage, being no longer anxious
to engage the notice of men.</p>

<p>This fact serves to prove that clothes, which originated from
the first coverings, were originally worn to allure. It was not
the feeling of shame that caused resort to coverings and created
clothes, but the very coverings provoked in time the feeling of
shame.<a id="FNanchor_A_1" href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">A</a></p>

<p>Clothes owing their introduction to the irradiation of sex-attraction,
fashion never disowned their origin. Fashion, says
Bloch, bears witness of its intimate relationship to the vita
sexualis, in that it always started from the ranks of courtesans
and at the instance of opulent demi-mondaines. Gunther says:
The demi-monde has always, since fashions are in existence,
dictated them, in Rome, in Venice and now in Paris.</p>

<p>Fashion has in two ways introduced a sensual element in
dress. Either it renders conspicuous certain parts of the body
and exaggerates their size, by the shape of the garment, its
drapery and trimmings, or it leaves uncovered these parts to
catch the eye. Both manoeuvers aim at the production of a
sensual effect. The stretching of the skirt over the abdomen
and legs in such a way that the outlines of the hips and thighs
obtrude themselves upon the eye was surely invented by a Parisian
demi-mondaine to serve sensuality. The corset, says Bloch,
aims to render conspicuous and prominent the specific female
organ, the bosom. It tries to effect an exciting contrast between
the form of the bosom and the slimness of the waist, increased
by tight lacing. At the same time, fashion dictates for a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
number of occasions an ample nudity of this most alluring female
organ.</p>

<p>The bosom of the woman, says Berg, is the organ by which
she is able to express herself most ingeniously. Its undulations
were always her most expressive and skilful rhetoric. The
bosom represents the woman’s language and her poetry, her
history and her music, her purity and her longing, her policy
and her religion, her worship and her art, her secret and her
convention, her character and her pride, her consciousness, her
magic mirror and her mystery. The bosom is the central organ
of all female ideas, desires and humors. No wonder, therefore,
that fashion concentrates its greatest endeavors and painstaking
effort upon this particular part of the female body. Being
Cupid’s most faithful servant, fashion selects this part which
it expects to serve best as the target of the winged god’s arrows.
To be sure, the individual refined and chaste woman is unaware
of the underlying principle of the creators of fashions. She is
convinced that clothes were adopted for esthetic reasons, although
the sculptor who knows most of beauty seldom covers up
the naked body. By heredity and social custom, clothing for
refined women has become a mere side current of irradiation
of the sensual. Clothes are used, by a majority of women,
mainly as a means of beautifying. Ornamental clothing is not
any longer a simple lure. It is a sign or symbol of a greater
refinement of perception and delicacy of feeling. By the use of
clothes the attention is directed rather to the personality than
to the person. It is an attempt to display psychical rather than
physical features. The impulse of the normal woman to attribute
an exaggerated value to clothes is more an imaginative
radiation and far remote from the desire of physical exhibition.
But as far as fashion is concerned, the original close connection
between clothes and the attraction of the sexes is still the commanding
principle. Fashion is still standing in the service of
sensuality. This explains its modern fickleness. In previous
epochs the same mode of dress was worn for centuries, as the
European peasant’s dress shows. The present feverishly frequent
change of fashion is a pathological phenomenon, betraying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
diseased eagerness for ever stronger and more original sensual
stimulations.</p>

<p>Love and sex attraction being the chief objects in the lives
of a considerable part of mankind, it is surprising that until
recently sexuality was not looked upon with great favor, and
that a sane knowledge of sex and reproduction was assiduously
withheld from the people. While our ancestors considered the
sex functions sacred, by a strange mental process it is now considered
shameful. So deeply is the sense of shame morbidly
associated with the sensual desire that most people, and especially
women, frequently disavow their propensity and attempt
to hide their ardor from the world. They do not recognize that
normal, well-ordered amativeness is a physiological and moral
virtue, while manifestations of spurious spirituality are often
induced by certain perversions. Indifference to amatory pleasures
is frequently professed by those who resort to artificial
stimulants. Only those most occupied with amatory delights
feign to look with contempt upon sex and to despise its wonderful
functions.<a id="FNanchor_B_2" href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">B</a> To the really innocent and pure all things are
pure. The result of this morbid sense of shame is that there is
scarcely any other subject so completely ignored as the sex
function, although so much of the health and happiness of the
race depends upon it. This false sense of shame is the cause
of our modern fig-leaf modesty and prudery, which attributes a
particular obscene meaning to everything sexual. It has created
that diseased imagination, depraved beyond all hope, which can
find any prurient gratification in the cold, chaste nakedness of
ancient marble. The mere nude arms or legs of a small school
girl, the furnishings of a public bath-house, the naked limbs of
a Tirolian peasant, or the grandest works of art awaken in them
lascivious thoughts. Individuals with such traits are accustomed
to interject their own diseased imagination, guilty conscience
and obscene sentiments into the purest artistic creations,
be they sculptured, painted, written or spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>The prudery and obscenity of these victims of a diseased
imagination and perverted moral sense have succeeded in distorting
our judgment on questions of sex in such a way that
any desire for scientific instruction in these subjects has become
inextricably confused with ideas of prurience and impropriety.
Matters pertaining to the generative functions are, as a rule,
excluded even from treatises on physiology. But for the anatomists
and alienists, nothing would be known about the physiology
of normal Love. The zealots wish to persuade us that the population
of the earth increases by the stork-method.</p>

<p>Even the physician who is often called upon for advice
about things pertaining to the psychological phase of sex, prudishly
ignores the mightiest of human instincts which is so intimately
related to human weal and woe. He is conversant with
the sexual question by virtue of its anatomical and physiological
knowledge, and he is well aware of its hygienic, sociological and
ethical importance. But when he is to furnish enlightenment
on psychic or pedagogic questions of sex, he is embarrassed because
of a lack of knowledge of sex psychology. The great
teachers in our medical schools, who ought to impart to their
pupils all their knowledge about the nature of things concerning
Love that they have gathered in their long and extensive
experience, seem either to consider Love a subject too sacred
for physiological and psychological analysis, or are really afraid
to arouse the anger of the zealots who made of the sanctuary of
sex-attraction a “noli me tangere.”</p>

<p>Only the writers of fiction and poetry are allowed to approach
the sanctuary of Love, because with their abnormal imagination
they sang dithyrambs on this natural sentiment and morbidly
transformed it into a supernatural, obscure phenomenon. The
hyperaesthetic writers of this morbid fiction are encouraged to
continue their practice of elevating the natural sentiment of
love to the height of a fetich, which only the lover is capable of
understanding. The scientist who dared to analyze this sentiment,
so important to the human race, and tried to enlighten
us about the nature of the attraction of the sexes, was met with
the cry, “To the Tarpeian rock.” The unbiased observer was
declared incapable of feeling and comprehending this natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
sentiment. Even philosophers, such as Schopenhauer, Hartman
and Spencer, though they touched upon the subject only from a
philosophical point of view, without probing it with the anatomist’s
scalpel, have been decried as heartless and soulless
cynics whom nature denied the possession of this sublimest of
sentiments, because they dared to attack the majesty of Love.</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, that no other physical function has
been treated with so stepmotherly a regard and scant attention
as the important instinct of the preservation of the species, no
wonder that no other physiological phenomenon has been approached
with such hesitancy as the study of love in man. The
works on physiology and gynaecology are significantly silent on
the subject of this important sentiment, and the practitioner
who so often has to deal with the pathological side of love looks
in vain for light in his text-books.</p>

<p>In the last decennium, a certain change has taken place in
this respect. A wave of sex discussion is sweeping over the
civilized countries of the world. The former taboo on the discussion
of sexual matters has been more or less removed and the
veil lifted. Things which not very long ago could not have
been mentioned in polite society except in whispers and with
low breath, are now publicly discussed in season and out of
season. As it is often the case, we have turned from the one
extreme of complete darkness to the other extreme of too glaring
light. Sex enlightenment runs rampant at present. It
haunts the stage, lurks in innumerable societies and crops out
in newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>But, although the world is full of sex discussion, the emphasis
is generally laid upon sex-hygiene and upon the knowledge
of the relations of the sex function to mental and physical development.
Sex-hygiene is nowadays held to be a proper subject
of pedagogy and is taught in many schools and colleges.
But the emotion of Love is still very little studied, and it is
still wrapped in complete darkness. A great deal of ignorance
still prevails in regard to this important emotion. Few people
understand under this much-abused word one and the same
emotion. The same word is used to designate entirely different
feelings. The ancient Greeks had three different words to ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>press
the different emotions that go under the name of love.
One of the highest emotions is expressed by the word ἀγαπάω.
It is the love man feels for God, parents or country. It is the
love founded upon worship, adoration, gratitude and habit. The
other kind of love was expressed by the word φιλέω. It designates
the love founded on sympathy and liking, as the love of
friends, of humanity, of wisdom. The last, amatory emotion, was
expressed by the word ἐράω. It is the love founded upon sex-attraction.
It is a purely instinctive emotion, found throughout
the animal kingdom and even among some plants. Hence
it is just the feeling which should not be treated with such
besotted reverence. True enough sexual passion is the passion
of creation, the most important function in the universe. Sympathy,
affection, fidelity, sacrifice, indeed, all those noble traits,
included under the term altruism, spring from the reproductive
instinct. Still the two emotions, love, sung by poetry and exalted
by art, and sex-attraction, found in animals and plants as
well as in man, can not be identical. Still they are both generally
confounded even by the best writers.</p>

<p>To spread more light upon this important subject is the
aim of this treatise. It has been written for the elucidation of
the normal amatory emotions, considering the pathological
changes only by way of contrast, for the perusal of the profession
of medicine and of students of medical jurisprudence.</p>

<small>ORGANIC EVOLUTION</small></h3>


<p>The emotion of love, like any other psychic trait, is subject
to the laws of evolution. Its history is written on the pages of
Life’s book. The amatory emotions have followed step by step
the evolution of plant and animal.</p>

<p>The fact of organic evolution is nowadays tacitly accepted
even by those powers who in a not very remote period fought
against the theory of the heliocentric system. What is still <i>sub
judice</i> is the method of evolution. Here we have two main
theories:</p>

<p>1. The mechanistic.</p>

<p class="pi2">
(a) Neo-Lamarckians.<br />
(b) Neo-Darwinians.<br />
</p>

<p>2. The vitalistic.</p>

<p class="pi2">
(a) Teleology.<br />
(b) Creative evolution.<br />
</p>

<p>According to the mechanistic theory, all life can be accounted
for through the application of the laws of physics and
chemistry, while the claim of the vitalistic theory is that physics
and chemistry do not explain all. Teleology holds that life is
carrying out a prearranged plan; creative evolution postulates
a blind primordial energy, a psychic force, a life impetus, without
any prearranged plans. The Neo-Lamarckians hold that
acquired characteristics during the lifetime of the individual
are transmitted to its offspring. This transmission is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
method of evolution. The Neo-Darwinians deny the transmission
of acquired characteristics and claim that evolution has
been and is effected by natural selection. The animal’s germ-cells
being a product of its own soma-cells and the parents’ germ-cells,
they must change continually, since the soma-cells are
being continually changed. Those germ-cells which are beneficial
to the organism are selected by nature for preservation.
The claim of the Lamarckians is that environment gives rise to
variation, while the Darwinians maintain that a given variation
is selected by environment for survival.</p>

<p>All four theories assume evolution as a fact. That the neck
of the giraffe, for example, has been evolved to reach the leaves
of high trees is admitted by all of them; they only differ in the
principle underlying this evolution. According to teleology, the
faculty to evolve a long neck has been infused into the protoplasm
by the creative power, according to a prearranged plan.
Creative evolution assumes a blind primordial vital impetus
without purpose, end or aim. Organic life is an infinite addition,
a continuance without conclusion. Creation, once started,
the long neck has evolved without any previously arranged plan.
The Neo-Lamarckian explains the evolvement of the long neck
by the continual stretching of the organ to reach the leaves of
high trees. The increase in length was then transmitted from
generation to generation, each generation contributing its quota.
In this way the present long neck has been evolved. The Neo-Darwinian
assumes an accidental variation. At one time in the
animal’s history an animal with a long neck has been accidentally
bred. This variation with its higher survival value survived
during a scarcity of food, while the low-necked varieties disappeared.</p>

<p>Neither of the four theories gives entire satisfaction to the
fastidious critic. The mechanistic theory denies or rather ignores
the presence of an intelligence in the universe, and the
human mind, as now constituted, can not understand how the
power, that could create a substance with the potentiality to develop
into the human intellect, could itself be devoid of intellect.
If, on the other hand, the creative power is endowed with intelligence,
then its working without aim or purpose is equally un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>thinkable.
The vitalistic theory offers other difficulties. Teleology,
for instance, does not answer the question why an intelligence,
unlimited by space and time, omnipotent and omniscient,
should need the vast machinery of evolution to accomplish its
end; why could it not create a full-fledged Adam of the theologist?
Moreover, the human mind can not grasp the How,
Whence and the Where of the Supreme Intelligence, except by
faith, and science has no dealing with faith. The same objection
may be raised against creative evolution, whence this initial,
vital impetus, whence this original life?</p>

<p>The part of the mechanistic theory enunciated by the Neo-Lamarckians
seems quite probable. Nature, or environment,
does sometimes change organic beings either by chemical or by
physical influences, and these changes are not seldom transmitted
to the offspring. Antonio Marro (First Eugenic Congress) cites
a case where a bull while leaving the stable had its tail cut off,
the door suddenly closing; all the calves born through the impregnation
of this bull were tailless. Marro also made guinea-pigs
epileptic by the resection of the sciatic nerve, and the offspring
of the animals were also epileptic. Climate, temperature,
moisture, nutrition and unusual activity produce effects upon
the organism, and the offspring of the new generation have in
their blood and brain the consequences of the habits of their
ancestors. Prolonged disuse of an organ causes its degeneration
and often its disappearance. High temperature changes the
color of insects which is then inheritable or racial. Poisons such
as alcohol, syphilis, arthritic diathesis, intoxicants of contagious
diseases do also change the germ-plasma. Franz Boas (“The Immigration
Commission. Changes in bodily form of descendants
of Immigrants”) has found that none of the characteristics of the
human types that come to America remain stable. Not even those
characteristics of a race which have proved to be most permanent
in their old home, as the form of the head, remain the same under
the new surroundings. The length of the head of the brachycephalic
Hebrews is increased, the width of the head and of the face
is decreased. On the other hand, the length of the head of the
dolichocephalic Sicilians is decreased, while the width of the
head is increased. The effect of these changes is the develop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>ment
of a greater similarity of the descendants of Sicilians and
Hebrews, one to the other. The height of body of the American-born
Hebrew is increased. This influence of American environment
upon the descendants of immigrants shows that acquired
characteristics are transmissible. On the other hand, many
facts tend to show that acquired characteristics, as a rule, are
not transmitted to the offspring. Since the beginning of history
circumcision has been practised among the Jews, still the Jewish
boy is born with an intact prepuce.</p>

<p>For the reason that in the majority of cases acquired characters
are not transmissible, the Darwinian rejects the explanation
of evolution by appetency, or the use and disuse of certain organs,
and assumes a quasi “deus ex machina” in the form of
variation.</p>

<p>Ordinary variation is a fact that can not be disputed. No
two plants or animals are exactly alike. The amphimixis or
the blending of the inheritances of two individuals is, according
to Weismann, the great factor in the production of variations.
The two parents of every animal or plant have the species-character
in common, but there are certain distinctive traits that
hybridize. Hence ordinary variation is a fact, and Nature by
selection may evolve, in a slow way, new species, just as Luther
Burbank creates new kinds by artificial selection. Favorable
variations are then bound to furnish the possessor with a greater
power of resistance and with higher possibilities of life and propagation.
Evolution, accordingly, occurs primarily through sudden
mutations or sports which are the fittest for survival.</p>

<p>While the principle upon which the Lamarckian doctrines
rest is the power of adaptation, the basis of evolution for the
Darwinian is the transmissibility of unlikeness or individuality
just as likeness. Acquired characters are not transmitted; each
generation has to make a fresh start. It does not begin where
the last generation has left off. But variations are transmitted
to the offspring, and evolution proceeds by sports or by the
transilient variation.</p>

<p>A serious objection to this theory is the tendency of Nature
to revert to the normal average of the race. The law of Galton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
means the return to the mean of the species. The children of
the sport tend to return towards the mean of the race.</p>

<p>Thus the four explanations do not satisfactorily explain,
and the subject of the method of evolution is not yet decided.
Neither teleology with the initiatory psychic energy working
towards definite ends, nor Bergson’s vital impulse or original
profound cosmic force, nor Lamarck’s appetency or use and
disuse, nor Darwin’s natural selection, furnish an unobjectionable
satisfactory explanation of organic evolution. Still the world’s
thinkers and scientists have accepted organic evolution as a fact
which may be proven by embryonic development, in conformity
with Haeckel’s biogenetic axiom that ontogeny is only a short
recapitulation of phylogeny.</p>

<p>The ovum or even the zygote (i. e., the impregnated ovum)
is a single-celled organism and resembles the animals of the
first or lowest type in the animal kingdom. The protozoa are
nothing else than single-celled animals. Some of them have
even a lower structure than the common cell. The Monera, e. g.,
has neither nucleus nor membrane. The manifestations of life
are recognizable only by the possession of the faculties of the
assimilation of food and of propagation by segmentation and
division.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="title">CUT I.</div>
<img src="images/i_pg017.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">a, cell; b, morula; c, blastula; d, gastrula; ec, ectoblast; en, endoblast.</div>
</div>

<p>Like the protozoon, the ovum, immediately after its impregnation,
begins to undergo a certain division, by a series of
successive segmentations, into 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc., cells.
By continuous cell segmentations a great mass, the morula or
mulberry, is produced. The structure of the morula corresponds
with that of the coelenterata, or the animals of the second type.
To this type belong the animals with gemmiparous reproduction,
or multiplication by means of buds. The divided animals remain
together and form colonies, as e. g. in sponges or corals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>The next event in the formation of the embryo is the
blastula. The solid spherical mass of cells becomes hollow like a
rubber ball. In the subsequent stage the blastula becomes flat
at one pole. By degrees a depression is formed at this point,
which becomes deeper step by step, until the inner layer reaches
the outer layer, representing half a sphere of two layers, like a
collapsed rubber ball. In the farther growth the edges approach
the middle line till they finally meet and fuse together. The
oval body, called the gastrula, thus consists of two layers, the
primitive germinal membranes, the ectoderm and entoderm.
The gastrula resembles in its structure that of the worms, or
the third type of the animal kingdom.</p>

ac, abdominal cavity; cd, chorda dorsalis; it, intestinal cavity.</div>
</div>



<p>By certain foldings of the ento- and ectoderm transformations
arise, and new organs develop. Two folds of the entoderm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
grow higher, approach each other and finally meet. In this way
the embryo consists of four germinal membranes. A certain
folding of the ectoderm marks the position of the future backbone
in the primitive stripe. A longitudinal furrow marks the
origin of the nerve-tube. The different membranes have thus
formed several tubes, the chorda dorsalis, the definitive intestinal
canal and the abdominal cavity or coelom. The structure of the
embryo resembles now more or less that of the animals of the
fourth type or the echinodermata.</p>

<p>The membranes which include the intestinal canal soon
overgrow on both sides the nerve-tube and the chorda and are
then differentiated partly into the bones of the skeleton and
partly into the muscles. In the meantime, the vascular spaces
develop. At one point of the vascular tube a rhythmical pulsation
is observed, representing the primitive heart, similar to
that of the mollusca.</p>

<p>A certain fold, the head-fold, arises at the front end of
the embryo by the bending of the spinal column. Beneath the
head-fold arise five processes or gills, as in fishes, which later on
are transformed into the face of the fetus. Four other processes
are budded off from the trunk and subsequently become the extremities.
A furrow at the ventral side of the embryo shows
the origin of later trachea and lungs. On both sides of the
head-fold can be seen two pits for the eyes. At this point, the
embryo is in the same stage of development as many arthropoda.</p>

<p>The skeleton begins now to ossify. The heart tube begins
to bend and takes the form of an “S.” In this way the tube is
turned into an auricle and ventricle as in the amphibia. The
ventricle is then divided by a partition as in the reptiles. One
part of the nerve-tube is differentiated into three cerebral vesicles,
as in birds.</p>

<p>Thus the embryo resembles in its structure at different
stages the structure of the different types of the animals of the
animal kingdom. The different formations do not follow the
chronological order as described, but, as a rule, they take place
synchronously. At the end of the fourth month the fetus is
about sixteen centimeters or six inches long and has reached
its definite human shape.</p>

<small>EVOLUTION OF THE GENITAL SYSTEM</small></h3>


<p class="subh"><i>A. The Indifferent Stage</i></p>

<p>Before the last described stage has been reached, there has
developed simultaneously with the other organs a set of organs,
known under the name of the genito-urinary system, which
deserves here our special attention.</p>

<p>The urinary secretion is effected throughout the animal
kingdom by three systems: the pronephros or the head-kidney;
mesonephros, or primitive kidney, or Wolffian body, “Urniere”;
and metanephros, or true kidney. The pronephros must be regarded
as the phylogenetically oldest part, since only traces of
it are found in the human embryo. Here in the earlier stages of
embryonic development, the Wolffian body is the organ for the
urinary secretion.</p>

<p>The Wolffian body, or mesonephros, appears in the shape of
two longitudinal protuberances on either side of the mesentary
along the spinal column. The protuberances consist of a series
of transverse excretory tubules or nephrides. These tubules
open into two pronephric ducts, or Wolffian ducts, which are
running alongside the abdominal aorta. These two Wolffian or
primitive male ducts open at the caudal end of the embryo into
the hind-end of the alimentary canal, or the cloaca (Cut III,
Fig. 2).</p>

<p>When the Wolffian body has almost reached its greatest development
a second longitudinal duct makes its appearance by
the evagination of the ventral surface of the Wolffian body.
These ducts lie in close proximity of the Wolffian ducts, along
the dorsal aspect of the coelom, or body-cavity, and are known
as the ducts of Müller, or the primitive female ducts. The function
of these canals in lowly organized animals is that of receiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
from the body-cavity the ova and of evacuating them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
the body. The Müllerian ducts also open into the cloaca. At
the lower end the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts run in close
apposition and form the genital cord. At this stage of development
the embryo is thus hermaphroditic like the worms.</p>

</div>

<p>The metanephros, or the true kidney, appears first as an
epithelial or renal evagination of the Wolffian duct on the dorsal
side of the latter and near its opening into the intestinal canal
or cloaca. This bud grows forward, extends headward toward
the position of the Wolffian body and becomes a long, narrow
tube, the ureter. The blind end branches into different tubules,
each having a sacculated end. They soon assume a tortuous and
convoluted form and represent the permanent kidney. The
Wolffian body is now replaced in its function by the true kidney,
and enters into special relations with the sexual organs, by being
transformed into the genital apparatus of the male.</p>

<p>Before the Wolffian body has yet degenerated the mesothelial
cells overlying the free surface of that body, at its upper part,
and at the ventro-mesial side, assume a high columnar form
and form an elongated swelling, known as the internal genital
ridge. As the degeneration of the Wolffian body proceeds the
genital ridge is differentiated into the indifferent sexual gland,
by producing a projection upon the wall of the coelom or body
cavity. This prominence is attached to the surface of the Wolffian
body by a fold of the peritoneum. At this stage there is no
distinction of sex. The sexual gland represents the indifferent
type of the sexual apparatus.</p>

<p>While this metamorphosis is going on at the head-end of
the sexual ducts, the caudal ends undergo also a certain degree
of development.</p>

<p>In the early embryonic life the intestinal canal is in communication
with the allantois. In fact, both form one continuous
canal. When the caudal, pointed end of the intestine becomes
obliterated, the allantois-duct on the ventral side, and the intestine
on the dorsal side, both open into a kind of pouch, the
cloaca. When the body-cavity of the embryo closes in the course
of farther development, the allantois, which is the connecting
link between the embryo and the placenta, enters the embryo by
the small opening known as the umbilicus. Very soon the middle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
segment of the intra-embryonic allantois dilates and assumes the
form of a spindle-shaped sac, the later urinary bladder. The
portion of the intra-embryonic allantois, connecting the summit
of the bladder with the umbilicus, soon becomes an impervious
cord, known as the urachus. The portion of the allantois intervening
between the bladder and the intestine is designated as
Sinus Urogenitalis.</p>

<p>Into this sinus opens the short canal, connecting the lower
end of the bladder with the upper end of the urogenital sinus
which becomes later on the urethra. The sinus also receives the
genital ducts, the Müllerian and the Wolffian ducts, and the
latter’s evaginations, the ureters. Later on, owing to alterations
through unequal growth, the orifices of the ureters, which
originally lie in close apposition with the openings of the Wolffian
ducts, change their position and are moved toward the bladder.
The interval between the two pairs of ducts, the Wolffian ducts
and the ureters, increases, until the ureters finally open into
the bladder.</p>

<p>The intra-embryonic allantois has thus furnished the following
organs: the solid cord urachus, or ligamentum vesico-umbilicale,
the urinary bladder, the urethra and the urogenital
sinus. The latter is still in communication with the intestine by
means of the cloaca.</p>

<p>At the next step ridges or folds spring from each side of
the cloaca, grow toward each other, until they finally coalesce
and form a complete septum. By farther development the
original epithelial septum becomes the permanent perineum.
Since the intestine is now no longer in communication with the
urogenital sinus, the cloaca as such disappears. At this stage
the intestine ends in a blind sac. It is closed up towards the
exterior by the anal membrane. Neither are urethra and genital
canal in communication with the exterior. They both open
into the urogenital sinus, and the latter is closed up towards the
exterior by the urogenital membrane. The anal membrane soon
breaks through and the rectum opens to the exterior by the way
of the anus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>


<p class="subh"><i>B. The Internal Male Sexual Organs</i></p>

<p>After the genital ridge had made its appearance, columns
of cells begin to grow down into the substance of the Wolffian
ridge. The columns are composed of two kinds of cells, small
epithelial cells and large spherical cells, known as sex-cells. Two
regions may be now recognized in the ridge, the rete-region and
the sex-gland region. The cell-columns of the rete region are
termed “rete-cords,” and the cell columns of the sex-gland
region are called “sex-cords.” The sex-cords unite to form a
complicated network and the rete-cords grow backward to the
Wolffian ridge. They then develop a lumen and send off branches
to the sex-cord reticulum.</p>

<p>The genital portion of the Wolffian body persists in the male
in its entirety and serves as the efferent ducts of the testis. They
open into the upper part of the Wolffian duct. The latter is retained
complete. The portion nearest the testis is thrown into
coils and forms a part of the epididymis, the remainder is converted
into the vas deferens and the ductus ejaculatorius and
the lateral outpouching of the wall, the vesicula seminalis.</p>

<p>The Müllerian ducts disappear completely in the male.
Only the lower ends of the ducts fuse to form the sinus pocularis,
or utriculus prostaticus.</p>


<p class="subh"><i>C. The Internal Female Sex Organs</i></p>

<p>In the female the Wolffian body and ducts degenerate. The
remainder of the body is known as the parovarium, an organ
without any apparent function, while the remainder of the ducts
are designated the ducts of Gartner.</p>

<p>The ovary is produced from the asexual stage by the following
metamorphosis. The mesothelial cells on the peritoneal
surface of the sexual gland change into the germinal epithelium
and form the so-called egg-columns or sexual cord which represent
the primitive ova.</p>

<p>At the caudal end, the Müllerian ducts fuse together into
one, the walls, along the entire line of the union, degenerate,
and the two ducts thus form a single duct, the later vagina and
uterus. Until the fifth month there is no distinction between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span><br /><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
vagina and uterus, the two organs form a single sac-like structure.
At the beginning of the fifth month, a circular ridge in
the wall of the sac makes its appearance and marks the division
between the vagina and the uterus. When the lower portion of
the two Müllerian ducts have fused to form a single canal, the
utero-vaginal sac, the lumen of the vagina is still obliterated,
being filled with epithelial cells. By the breaking down of the
central epithelial cells, the cavity is established.</p>

<p>At this period a little semicircular crescentic fold attached
to the dorsal margin of the aperture of the vagina arises and
forms the hymen, an organ which has always played such an
important rôle in the fancy of all nations.</p>

<p>The upper blind ends of the Müllerian ducts, with their
expanded funnel-shaped mouths, diverge and form the oviducts,
or the Fallopian tubes.</p>


<p class="subh"><i>D. The External Genitals</i></p>

<p>At the time when the urethra, the sexual ducts and the intestine
still open into the sac-like tube, the so-called cloaca, there
is distinguishable on the exterior surface of the body, corresponding
to the position of the cloaca, a certain depression called the
cloacal depression. When the intestine is separated from the
cloaca by the septum, the later perineum, the exterior cloacal
depression is cut into two, the anal and the urogenital depressions.
Between the urogenital depression, later called the genital
groove, exteriorly and the urogenital sinus interiorly, there is
only a dividing membrane, the urogenital membrane which later
on breaks through and transforms the entire sinus into a shallow
depression, termed the vestibule.</p>

<p>Before the urogenital sinus has opened to the exterior the
mesenchym surrounding the urogenital depression exteriorly
begins to thicken and produces an encircling elevation, the genital
swelling. On the ventral side within this swelling appears
a projection, the genital tubercle, which is thus surrounded by
the genital swelling. The tubercle soon increases in size, so that
the urogenital depression, now called the genital groove, becomes
partly situated at its under aspect (Cut 5, Fig. 2). The lips of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span><br /><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
this genital groove thicken and form the two genital folds. All
these four organs are common in both sexes and represent the
asexual or bisexual state of the external genital organs.</p>


<p class="subh"><i>E. The Male External Genitals</i></p>

<p>In the male the genital tubercle increases enormously in
size to form the penis. Its extremity becomes bulbously enlarged
and forms the glans penis. The lips of the groove or rather of
the vestibule, since by this time the urogenital membrane had
broken through and had transformed the sinus urogenitalis into
the vestibule, the so-called genital folds, meet together and fuse,
thus converting the vestibule and the groove into the terminal
portion of the male urethra and bringing it about, that the
ductus ejaculatorii and the sinus pocularis open upon the floor
of that passage. The prostate, consisting of several independent
glands, has also its openings at this point. In its development
the prostate belongs to the urethra as well as to the sinus urogenitalis.
The two genital swellings are brought closer together
in the male and form the scrotum, a sac containing two separate
pouches into which the testes descend.</p>


<p class="subh"><i>F. The Female External Genitals</i></p>

<p>In the female the vestibule, or the shallow depression which
was formed through the breaking through of the urogenital
membrane, remains open throughout life, and is termed the
vestibule of the vulva. From the sides of the lower part of
the sinus a pair of evaginations are formed and give rise to the
Bartholinian glands. The vestibule being in fact the open sinus
urogenitalis, the urethra and the vagina naturally have their
orifices in the same.</p>

<p>The genital tubercle ceases to grow in the female and becomes
the clitoris. The genital folds or the lips of the vestibule
become prolonged and form the labia minora or the nymphae.
The genital swelling increases in size through adipose and
fibrous tissue. The part situated on the ventral side of the
clitoris becomes the mons veneris, while the lateral parts are
converted into the labia majora of the vulva.</p>

THE MALE GENITALS</h3>


<p>The knowledge of the anatomy of the genitals, of the
mechanism of erection and ejaculation, and the nervous centres
which preside over these functions, is essential for a clear comprehension
of sex-attraction in men and in women. It will,
therefore, be of some profit even to medical men briefly to recall
to memory those parts of the human anatomy which have a particular
bearing upon the subject of this treatise.</p>

<p><i>Scrotum.</i>—The main generative glands in the male, the
testicles, are situated within a bag, the so-called scrotum, outside
of the abdominal cavity. This bag or pouch, hanging between
the thighs, below the symphysis, consists of two compartments
which are separated by the septum scroti. The scrotum
may be considered as a diverticle of the anterior abdominal wall.
Before the descent of the testicles from the abdominal cavity,
two diverticles of the abdominal wall are formed, at two points
anteriorly to the genital swelling, where later on the inguinal
canals are found. The diverticles extend to the swelling and
coalesce to form the bag. The raphe, or last, at the point of their
union, can be observed through the entire life of the individual.
This median raphe runs from the perineum to the penis, indicating
the inner division of the scrotum.</p>

<p>The scrotum being a derivative of the abdominal wall, it
follows that its wall will consist of the same elements as the
abdominal wall. The first layer of the abdominal wall, the epi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>dermis
or cutis, forms also the epidermis of the scrotum. The
fascia superficialis abdominis constitutes the second layer of the
scrotum, or the tunica dartos. The musculus obliquus abdominis
externus goes to make up the third layer, the so-called Cooper’s
fascia. The musculus obliquus abdominis internus forms the
fourth layer, or the musculus cremaster externus. The musculus
transversalis abdominis furnishes the cremaster internus muscle,
and the tunica vaginalis communis, or the fifth layer. Finally,
the double layer of the abdominal peritoneum forms the tunica
vaginalis propria of the scrotum. Between the two lamina of
this tunica is found some fluid which, when pathologically increased,
constitutes the anomaly called hydrocele.</p>

<p><i>Testicle.</i>—The testicle is an ovoid organ with two surfaces,
a median and lateral, with two poles, an upper and lower pole,
and two margins, an anterior convex and a posterior straight
margin. In the natural position, the upper pole is somewhat
anteriorly inclined. The average weight of the testicle is 15 to
25 grammes, average length 5 centimeters, breadth 2 to 5 centimeters
and thickness 3 centimeters. The superior pole and the
posterior margin of the testicle are covered by the epididymis.
The left testicle, as a rule, hangs deeper than the right.</p>

<p><i>Descent of testicles.</i>—In embryonic life already, the testicle
is connected, at its lower pole, with the bottom of the scrotal
diverticle, the latter ventricle of the scrotum, by a cord containing
unstriped muscular fibres, the so-called gubernaculum testis.
This cord does not grow in length, hence, with the growth of
the embryo, the testicle has to descend from its position, on
either side of the mesentary along the spinal column. Thus,
in the seventh month of embryonic life, each testicle descends
through its respective inguinal canal into its compartment in the
scrotum. In this descent the testicle takes along its peritoneal
covering. When the bottom of the scrotum has been reached
this peritoneal covering, together with the lining of the scrotum
coalesce, and the two lamina form the above-mentioned tunica
vaginalis propria.</p>

<p><i>Structure of testicles.</i>—The testicle is covered with a thick,
white, fibrous coat, the tunica albuginea. This tunica sends off
about 200 to 400 septa or trabeculae testis. These trabeculae<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
divide the parenchymatous tissue of the testicle into numerous
conical lobules, and, converging towards the posterior margin
of the testicle, form a solid fibrous mass, the so-called corpus
Highmori.</p>

<p>The parenchymatous tissue of the testicles consists of numerous
fine tubules, the canaliculi seminiferi. Each lobule contains
a number of these fine tubules. In the beginning and
through their entire course the seminal tubules or canaliculi are
tortuous; towards their ends, however, they become straight.
When they reach the corpus Highmori, the thickened, enlarged
part of the tunica albuginea, they collect and unite, to form a
network, the rete vasculosum. This rete sends off 12 to 14 large
tubules, the vasa efferentia, which, running in a straight line,
pass the corpus Highmori and enter the epididymis. The corpus
Highmori serves as a point of entrance for the arteries and
nerves and as an exit for the veins of the testicles.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Epididymis.</i>—The epididymis is the excretory duct of the
testicle. It is situated at the posterior margin of the same, covering
this margin and the upper pole of the testicle. The upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
end of the epididymis tapers off to pass into the vas deferens.
The epididymis is divided into the head, middle piece and tail.
At the lower point, the tail turns directly upwards and backwards,
and is now called vas deferens. The vasa efferentia enter
the epididymis at the head. The unfolded vas epididymis is
about six meters long. Its diameter is about 0.5 millimeter. It
gradually dilates as it approaches the vas deferens.</p>

<p><i>Vas deferens.</i>—The vas deferens runs down the posterior
wall of the epididymis and turns upwards to enter the abdominal
cavity through the inguinal canal. It then runs between bladder
and rectum to end as the ductus ejaculatorius. Before the vas
deferens receives the duct of the seminal vesicle it forms a
spindle-like enlargement, the so-called ampulla. The vas deferens
opens under the name of ductus ejaculatorius into the
prostatic urethra.</p>

<p>The length of the vas deferens is about 60 centimeters, its
diameter is about 3 millimeters. The wall of the vas deferens
is very thick, giving on palpation the feeling of a piece of rope.
It is lined inside with a light cylindrical epithelium which rests
upon a layer of fibrous connective tissue. This fibrous substratum
is surrounded by a thick, muscular coat of non-striated
fibres. The muscular coat is composed of two longitudinal
layers, which include between them a circular layer. The muscular
coat is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue, the so-called
adventitia.</p>

<p><i>Spermatic cord.</i>—In its course from the testicle to the internal
ring of the inguinal canal the vas deferens is accompanied
by the arteria and vena spermaticae internae. The three organs
form the spermatic cord. But although the three organs are intimately
connected, still the vas deferens is recognizable without
difficulty by its rope-like consistency and is easily severed, as in
the operation for the sterilization of the male. The vein forms
a tendril-like tress-work, which is called the plexus pampiniformis.
In pathological conditions the plexus forms the varicocele.</p>

<p><i>Seminal vesicles.</i>—The seminal vesicles may be considered
as diverticles of the vasa deferentia. The vesicles are lying in the
sulcus, between the prostate and the bladder, and extend oblique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>ly
outward and backward. The length of the seminal vesicles is
about 8 centimeters, their diameter is about 7 millimeters. The
vesicles form a bulbous mass of convoluted tubes. Being a derivative
from the vas deferens, the wall of the tubes consists of
the same strata as the vas deferens, i. e., of an adventitia followed
by the muscular coat, then by the fibrous substratum, and
finally by a layer of cylindrical epithelia. The mucous membrane
possesses numerous tubulous glands. In this way the
vesicles serve not only as reservoirs for the sperma, but may be
considered as veritable glands. By the junction of the pointed
ends of the seminal vesicles with the vasa deferentia, the ejaculatory
ducts are formed.</p>

differs little from that of the vas deferens and of the
seminal vesicles.</p>

the membranous and the cavernous parts. The prostatic
part is the widest portion of the entire urethra. It is surrounded
by an unstriped muscular layer and the muscles of the prostate.
The membranous part is the narrowest, shortest, and most thin-walled
portion of the three parts of the urethra. It is entirely
surrounded by the muscular fibres of the diaphragma urogenitale,
which takes here a circulatory course. It is in this way situated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
on the border-line of the abdominal cavity and the exterior,
within the abdominal wall. The cavernous portion of the urethra
is surrounded by the corpus cavernosum urethrae. This
portion shows two dilatations, one in the bulbous part, just anterior
to the termination of the membranous part, where the
ducts of the two Cowper’s glands open; the other dilatation is
near the end, behind the meatus, forming the so-called fossa
navicularis. The meatus itself is the narrowest part of the
entire urethra. Numerous mucous crypts, the glands of Littré
and certain lacunae, the largest among them near the fossa,
open into the lumen of this part of the urethra. The entire
urethra is lined with a cylindrical epithelium, except at the
fossa navicularis. The latter is covered by a layer of pavement
epithelia. The length of the urethra is about 18 centimeters. In
the usual state the urethra possesses only a virtual lumen, i. e.,
the walls touch each other.</p>

<p><i>Prostate.</i>—The prostate is a gland, chestnut-like in shape.
Its greatest diameter is in average about 4 centimeters. The
diameter from the base to the apex is about 3 centimeters. The
thickness of the prostate is about 2 centimeters, and its weight
is about 18 grammes. The upper broad margin, the basis, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
adjacent to the bladder, the lower, narrower end, or the apex,
rests on the diaphragma urogenitale. It thus lies completely
within the abdominal cavity. The anterior surface is connected
with the lower end of the symphysis pubis by the ligamenta puboprostatica,
the posterior surface is connected with the rectum by
loose connective tissue. The prostate is lobulated and generally
divided into three lobes, a median and two lateral lobes. The
prostate embraces the neck of the bladder and the first portion
of the urethra.</p>

<p>The structure of the prostate is a framework of muscular
fibres, in which are embedded numerous racemous glands. The
latter collect and open into the prostatic ducts. The main substance
of the prostate is glandular. The mucous lining of the
prostate, which forms at the same time the mucous membrane
of the prostatic urethra, shows upon the posterior wall a linear
elevation of the mucous membrane which covers a fold of erectile
tissue, the so-called colliculus seminalis.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Colliculus.</i>—The colliculus is a massive button, 3 millimeters
in height and in breadth, and lies anteriorly to the fossa
prostatica. On the summit of the colliculus there is an opening
which leads to a pear-shaped pouch, the so-called sinus pocularis,
a remnant of the Müllerian ducts. The two orifices of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
ejaculatory ducts are found within the pouch, near its opening
into the urethra. The orifices of the prostatic ducts are situated
in the furrows, on either side of the colliculus. In the state of
erection the colliculus fills out the urethra completely and closes
it up tightly and absolutely, so that not a drop of urine can pass
out of the bladder or escape during ejaculation.</p>

<p><i>Cowper’s glands.</i>—Cowper’s glands are two acinose glands
of the size of a pea. They are embedded between the muscular
fibres of the musculus transversus perinei profundus. The ducts
run between the two leaflets of the diaphragma urogenitale to
the posterior end of the bulbus, hence within the cavernous
tissue near the septum and open on either side of the bulbus
on the floor of the bulbous urethra.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Penis.</i>—The penis is chiefly made up of three erectile
bodies, the corpus cavernosum urethrae and the two porpora
cavernosa penis. The latter arise each from the ramus descendens
ossis pubis, by strong fibrous processes, the crura. The crura
converse and coalesce at the inferior margin of the symphysis
to which they are fastened by the ligamentum suspensorium penis
mediale. The anterior ends of the corpora cavernosa are rounded.
They are situated in the furrow of the glans of the penis.
After their coalescence the two corpora are divided only by a
fibrous septum. The lower surface of the corpora shows a deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
furrow which serves as a receptacle for the corpus cavernosum
urethrae. The latter thus occupies the same relation to the
corpora cavernosa penis as does the ramrod to a double-barreled
gun.</p>

<p>The corpus cavernosum urethrae forms two expansions.
The anterior expansion is represented by the glans penis, the
posterior expansion by the bulb, a tuberous enlargement, situated
between the diverging crura of the corpora cavernosa penis. The
bulb is covered by the musculus bulbo-cavernosus.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the corpora cavernosa.</i>—The walls of the corpora
cavernosa are made up of a dense fibrous elastic membrane,
the tunica albuginea. From this tunica arise numerous trabeculae,
composed of fibrous tissue and non-striped muscular fibres.
In this way a sponge-like tissue is formed in which the spongy
superstructure consists of elastic fibres. The mesh-spaces are
filled with circulating blood. The spaces of these cavernous
bodies are covered with an endothelial lining like blood-vessels.
The caverns communicate with each other by the arteriae helicinae,
short arterial branches, anastomosing in the cavernous
spaces. The arteries, capillaries, and veins pass along the trabeculae
of the spongy tissue and open into the caverns. The
caverns may thus be considered as enlarged capillaries. The
arteria and vena profundae penis run through the middle of the
corpus.</p>

<p>The arteries within the trabeculae possess not only circular
muscular fibres, as all other arteries, but also longitudinal fibres.
These muscular fibres are normally contracted and thus prevent
the blood from flowing into the cavernous spaces. If by some
inhibitory influence the muscles are relaxed, the caverns are immediately
filled with blood. This blood has to return by the
vena profunda communis which passes through the unstriped
muscular fibres of the musculus transversus perinei profundus.
Hence by the contraction of this muscle the veins are compressed,
and the blood is prevented from flowing off. As a result,
the spongy and cavernous bodies become turgid and the corpora
cavernosa penis become stone hard. The blood of the corpus
cavernosum urethra, on the other hand, returns through the vena
dorsalis penis which enters the abdomen through connective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
tissue parts, beneath the symphysis. For this reason the corpus
cavernosum urethrae remains compressible even during erection.</p>

<p>The main muscles of the penis are the erector penis and the
bulbo-cavernosus. The latter arises from the central perineal
tendon and inserts by embracing the bulb. The erector penis
muscle arises at the inner surface of the tuberositas ossis ischii
and inserts into the sides of the crura.</p>

<p>The penis is covered with an integument which forms the
continuation of the skin of the abdominal wall, but it is somewhat
darker than the latter. At the anterior end a fold of skin
forms the prepuce which covers the glans penis.</p>

<p><i>Genital nerves.</i>—The genital nerves are of three different
kinds. There are first the efferent nerves, or centripetal nerves.
They are the sensitive terminal branches of the nervus pudendus
and end, or rather arise, in the genital nerve bulbs. They are
richly distributed throughout the prostatic part of the urethra.
These centripetal nerves are connected with the Pacinian corpuscles,
within the prostate, and with the extensive nerve-plexus,
interspersed with ganglia, which are found in the superficial
layers of the urethral mucosa as well as in the cortical layers of
the prostate. These nerves return to the centres in the spinal
cord and in the brain through the rami of the nervus pudendus.</p>

<p>The second kind of nerves are the centrifugal nerves, which
arise by two roots at the sacral plexus, from the first to the third
pair of sacral nerves. This sacral plexus sends off anastomosing
branches to the vesical plexus. The latter is made up of
branches from the hypogastric plexus of the sympathetic nerve
and of filaments from the sacral ganglia, the pudendal plexus
and the sacral nerves. The latter innervates the bladder, seminal
vesicles, the urethra, and the prostate. The nervi erigentes are
vasodilator-nerves. Their centre, in the lumbar part of the spinal
cord, is connected with the centre of the vasodilators of the
medulla oblongata by filaments, running within the spinal cord.
When these nerves or their centre are irritated, as in diseases of
the cord, or excited by electricity, erections will ensue.</p>

<p>The third kind of nerves are those of ejaculation. They
are centripetal and centrifugal nerves and run through the nervi
perinei, the latter being branches of the nervus pudendus com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>munis.
They innervate the ejaculatory ducts, the seminal vesicles,
vasa deferentia and testicles. The centre of these nerves
has also its seat in the lumbar portion of the spinal cord.</p>

<p><i>Genital centres.</i>—The centres for the genital nerves are
six in number, three cerebral, one in the medulla oblongata and
two spinal centres. There is first the cerebral centre of voluptas
or cupido. It is the seat of the sexual instinct or of sex desire.
The second centre is the centre of libido. It is the centre for
experiencing pleasure. The third centre is that of inhibition.
It is the centre where, under certain circumstances, sexual
activity is prevented. The vasodilator centre in the medulla
oblongata and the two spinal centres regulate erection and
ejaculation. Connecting fibres are passing between the cerebral
centres and the spinal centres. Hence psychic stimulation may
cause erection and ejaculation.</p>

<small>THE FEMALE ORGANS OF GENERATION</small></h3>


<p><i>Vulva.</i>—The main female generative organs are entirely
situated within the pelvis. The less important external organs
are those comprised in the name vulva (derived from the Latin
word valva, the folding door). When the woman is in erect
position, the vulva runs horizontally from the mons veneris to
the frenulum of the fossa navicularis.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Mons veneris.</i>—The mons veneris is the name of the fatty
cushion which rests upon the anterior surface of the symphysis
pubis. After puberty, the mountain is covered with a growth of
hair. In the female sex the hairs occupy a triangular area, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
base corresponding with the upper margin of the symphysis.
This sign is sometimes of value for the determination of the real
sex of an apparent hermaphrodite.</p>

<p><i>Labia majora.</i>—The labia majora are a pair of integumentary
folds, extending from the mons veneris to the perineum, or
the triangular partition between the anus and the vagina. Each
labium has two surfaces, an outer one pigmented and covered
with strong, crisp hair as on the mons veneris, and an inner
one, usually lying in close apposition with its fellow. The fissure
between the two labia is termed rima pudendi. The inner surfaces
are moist and resemble a mucous membrane in appearance.
The outer surface has the same structure as the skin. Beneath
the skin there is found a layer of connective tissue, rich in
elastic fibres and fatty tissue. The next layer is a dense mass of
adipose tissue, which is supplied with an abundant plexus of
veins. The labia are richly supplied with sebaceous glands.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Nymphae.</i>—The nymphae or the labia minora, are two
triangular structures which run parallel to the labia majora,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
from the clitoris to either side of the vaginal aperture. Their
free borders are crenulated or lobed. The nymphae consist of
thin folds of tissue, are smooth, and when protected, as in the
child, of a pale rose color, resembling a mucous membrane in
appearance. They contain numerous papillae and sebaceous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
follicles. Their interior contains connective tissue, some muscular
fibres and erectile tissue. Hence they take part in the
female erection. They are extremely sensitive, being abundantly
supplied with nerve-ends. At the side of the clitoris, each
nympha is divided into two lamellae. The two anterior lamellae
unite at the glans of the clitoris and form the praeputium clitoridis.
The posterior lamellae fuse at the back of the clitoris and
form the frenulum. The nymphae diverge backwards and terminate
in the middle of the rima.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Vestibulum.</i>—The vestibule is the area inclosed between
the two nymphae, extending from the clitoris to the fourchette.
Some authors call vestibule only the space from the clitoris to
the vaginal opening, the rest from the vaginal orifice to the
fourchette is then called fossa navicularis. On either side of
the vestibule, beneath the mucous membrane, embracing the
urethra, are situated the vestibular bulbs, two pyriform, thick,
erectile vein-plexus.</p>

<p><i>Bulbs.</i>—The bulbs are under the influence and partly covered
by the ischio-cavernosus and constrictor vagina muscles.
The lower ends terminate at the middle of the vaginal aperture.
Hence during the engagement under sexual excitement they
help to narrow the entrance of the vagina. The anterior ends of
the bulbs extend toward the clitoris and unite with the cavernous
tissue of this organ.</p>

<p><i>Clitoris.</i>—The clitoris is a small organ situated between the
branched anterior extremities of the nymphae which furnish the
praeputium and frenulum of the clitoris. It is rarely, even in
the state of erection, larger than two centimeters. The clitoris
consists of two crura, a corpus, and a small glans, which is
rarely exceeding a small pea in size. The crura arise from the
inferior surface of each ischio-pubic ramus of the pubic bone,
and after fusing below the pubic arch form the body of the
clitoris. The clitoris is sharply bent on itself, the glans looking
downward and backward towards the vaginal aperture.</p>

<p>The clitoris is the analogue of the male penis, with the only
difference that it is not perforated by the urethra. The latter
opens into the vestibule, midway between the clitoris and
vaginal orifice, and is surrounded by a fold of mucous mem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>brane.
The clitoris is equipped with two erectile organs, the
corpora cavernosa, and two muscles, the musculi ischio-cavernosi,
and is, therefore, very erectile. The clitoris is supplied with an
abundance of delicate sensory nerve-ends, including the end-bulbs
and the Pacinian and Meissner’s corpuscles, and is therefore
extremely sensitive.</p>

<p><i>Bartholinian glands.</i>—On either side of the vaginal orifice

are of the racemose type and not larger in size than a small pea.
They are situated beneath the bulbs of the vestibule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p><i>Hymen.</i>—The vaginal orifice, in the virginal state, is partly
closed by an imperfect septum, the hymen. The hymen is a
fold of tissue, presenting a structure similar to that of the vagina.
The fold is usually attached to the posterior vaginal wall. The
hymen closes only incompletely the vaginal entrance, leaving
an opening which varies in size from the head of a pin to a
calibre which will admit the tip of one or two fingers. The opening
of the hymen is, as a rule, semilunar and reaches the anterior
vaginal wall. After defloration or sometimes only after the first
confinement, the hymen is torn at several points and shows only
remnants, the so-called carunculae myrtiformes.</p>

<p><i>Vagina.</i>—The vagina is a musculo-membranous tube, extending
from the vulva to the uterus. The lumen is only virtual,
i. e., at rest the vaginal walls are in contact with each other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
and the passage appears as a fissure, the latter assuming on a
crosscut the form of the letter “H.” The walls of the vagina
are composed of three coats, an exterior connective tissue coat,
a thick muscular coat and a mucous membrane. The muscular
coat comprises two layers of strong unstriped muscular fibres,
the outer longitudinal, the inner circular. The latter, being
more largely developed near the vaginal aperture, forms a part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of the sphincter vaginae. The mucous membrane is covered
with a pavement epithelium and is equipped with a great number
of papillae, but is devoid of glands. The entire vagina is
surrounded by a strong net of venous blood-vessels. The anterior
vaginal wall is about seven centimeters long and presents
at the mucous surface a median longitudinal ridge; the posterior
wall is about ten centimeters long and has two ridges, from
which a number of transverse rugae pass, the columnae rugarum.
Only a small part of the posterior vaginal wall is in contact with
the floor of the pelvis and is covered with peritoneum. The
entire vaginal tube lies between the bladder and the rectum.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Uterus.</i>—The uterus is a hollow, pyriform, flattened, thick
muscular organ. It is divided into the upper thick end, or
fundus, the body, and the neck or cervix. The uterine cavity has
somewhat the shape of a triangle, its basis corresponding to the
uterine base. The uterine cavity communicates with the canals
of the Fallopian tubes by two openings at the angles of the
basis. The lower angle is continued into the cervical canal and
opens into the vagina. The median part of the cervical canal
is widened. The narrow opening into the cavity of the uterus
is known under the name of os internum, while the opening into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the vagina is called os externum. The uterine cavity is coated
with a mucous membrane, covered with columnar epithelia of
the ciliated type, which bears a great number of tubular glands.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the cervical canal shows a system
of small folds, the arbor vitae. The covering of the cervical
canal is also a high columnar, ciliated epithelium. The latter
changes into a pavement epithelium at the external os.</p>

</div>

<p>The second uterine coat consists of non-striated muscular
fibres. The uterus has no submucosa. There is an inner circular
and an outer longitudinal muscular layer. The larger uterine
blood-vessels lie chiefly between these two layers.</p>

<p>The cervix is composed mainly of connective tissue in which
is found a large amount of elastic fibres. The cervix contains
also erectile tissue of the same kind as the clitoris and the bulbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>The entire uterus, as far as it is not situated between other
organs, is covered with peritoneum. The anterior surface of
the uterus is almost flat and is covered with a layer of peritoneum
which is inflected upon the bladder at the level of the os internum.
The posterior surface is convex and covered, in its whole
extent, with a layer of peritoneum which is prolonged downward
for a short distance upon the posterior wall of the vagina.
The anterior and posterior peritoneal coverings unite laterally
and form the broad ligaments.</p>

<p>The uterus is fixed in its place by the round ligaments.
The latter are the continuations of the uterine tissue. They
run between the folds of the broad ligaments and through the
inguinal canals and terminate within the tissue of the labia
majora.</p>

<p>The uterus is normally anteflected, the fundus lying forward
near the symphysis, and the cervix to the rear. The average
length of the uterus is about seven centimeters, the breadth is
about four centimeters.</p>

<p><i>Fallopian tubes.</i>—The Fallopian tubes are two serpentine,
trumpet-shaped tubes, of about twelve centimeters in length.
They lie at the upper margin of the broad ligaments, between
the two layers of the same. The uterine half of the tubal canal
is narrow, about three millimeters in diameter, and opens into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
the basic uterine angle; the distal half is of a width of about
eight millimeters in diameter, widens into the ampulla and
opens into the abdominal cavity. This opening is surrounded
with fringes, one of which touches almost the ovary and probably
furnishes the road the ovum takes to reach the tube.</p>

columnar epithelium. The ciliar motion is toward the uterine
cavity. The mucous membrane forms a large number of plications

<p><i>Ovaries.</i>—The ovaries are two flattened almond-shaped organs
of about four centimeters in length and two centimeters
in breadth. They lie on the posterior surface of the ligamentum
latum, on either side of the uterus, with which they are connected
by the ligamenta ovarii. The ligament running between
the two lamellae of the ligamentum latum, leaves the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
through a fissure in the posterior lamella and enters the ovary
at the pointed end, the so-called hilus. The ovarian ligament
furnishes the fibrous tissue elements for the fibrous skeleton, the
stroma ovarii. The vessels and nerves also enter the ovary at
the hilus.</p>

<p>The ovary is covered with a cubical genital epithelium. The
epithelia put forth solid nests of epithelial cells into the fibrous
stroma. These nests represent the primitive ova. Some of these
cells become larger and, surrounded by the other unchanged or
follicular cells, are finally changed into permanent ova. The
entire crust of the ovary, the zona parenchymatosa, consists of
fibrous and epithelial elements. The interior part, the zona
vasculosa, consists of fibrous elastic tissue and of non-striated
muscular fibres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p><i>Graafian follicle.</i>—The ovum surrounded by the follicular
epithelium is called the Graafian follicle. The ripe Graafian
follicles lie usually near the periphery of the ovary. The
Graafian follicle is bubble-shaped and is surrounded by a fibrous
sheath, the theca folliculi. The cavity contains a light yellow
fluid, liquor folliculi. The interior of the cavity is coated with
several layers of follicular epithelia. This coat is called the
membrana granulosa. The follicular epithelia form at one point
a disc of cells, the discus oophorus, which includes in its midst
the ovum.</p>

spinal and one in the medulla oblongata. There is, in the first
place, the centre of voluptas or cupido, or the centre for the
sexual instinct; secondly the centre for experiencing libido or
pleasure, and thirdly the centre of inhibition, which under certain
circumstances, as in fear, disgust, grief, etc., prevents the
erection of clitoris, bulbs, and cervix. The inhibitory centre,
however, plays a secondary rôle in the female. The two spinal
centres are the centres of erection and of ejaculation.</p>

<p>The nerve-supply of the genitals is furnished by the spinal
nerves and the nervus sympathicus. The lumbar plexus,
formed by the four lumbar nerves, sends off the nervus ilio-inguinalis,
the terminal branches of which are distributed in the
mons veneris. The sacral plexus, formed by a part of the fourth
and the entire fifth lumbar nerves and the four upper sacral
nerves, sends off the nervus pudendus communis, which is distributed
in the clitoris, as nervus dorsalis clitoridis and in the
labia, as nervi labiales posteriores. The nerves of the vagina
are derived from the hypogastric plexus, the fourth sacral nerve
and the pubic nerve. The nerves of the uterus are derived
from the ovarian plexus, and from the third and fourth sacral
nerves. The nerves of the ovary are derived from the hypogastric,
pelvic and ovarian plexus. The oviducts are supplied
by the ovarian plexus. The nervi erigentes, distributed in the
corpora cavernosa of the clitoris, in the bulbs and in the erectile
tissue of the vagina and cervix, are derived from the hypogastric
plexus.</p>

<small>THE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS</small></h3>


<p>In the preceding two chapters there were described the
primary sexual characteristics of man and woman which are already
found in early foetal life. The secondary sexual characteristics,
by which we are able to distinguish the male from the
female, quite irrespective of the essential organs of reproduction
and by which the sexes are made more attractive to each
other, begin to develop at the time of puberty.</p>

<p>At this period of life certain changes take place in the
body of the child, and the differences between the sexes become
more pronounced. The stamp of sex is no longer confined to
the pelvis, but is impressed on every part of the body. In the
first years of existence the child is almost asexual, in physical
as well as in mental relation. The child is yet neutral; it is
only a spinal being or a digestive tube. All its actions are directed
upon one aim, the preservation of the individual. Hence
there is no great physical difference in children of the different
sexes. The differences begin to show with the beginning of
puberty and are definite at the close of this period. In the animal
kingdom, especially among birds and mammals, nature has
distinguished the male with the greater beauty. Man’s galantry
designates women as the beautiful sex.</p>

<p>The man’s figure is characterized by a relative robustness,
the forms are sinewy, the contours less rounded. The bony
prominences are more conspicuous and the muscles more clearly
defined. The skeleton is relatively larger, the stature is higher
and the form is erect. The head is much larger, and the growth
of the hair on it less pronounced. The male skull is more tilted
back, the occipital protuberance larger. The glabella or the
projection over the nose is more pronounced. The superciliary
ridges more prominent. The eyes, therefore, appear much
smaller. The lower jaw is markedly larger, the lips are thicker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span><br /><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
and the mouth is larger. Hence the face appears less delicately
cut. The chin and upper lip are covered with hair. Man’s neck
is less cylindrical than woman’s and presents four slightly flattened
surfaces. The laryngeal projection is highly pronounced.</p>

<p>Man’s shoulders are not sloping but square, showing traces
of sinews and muscles. The thorax is longer. The beautifully
rounded form of the female bosom is missing. The breasts appear
atrophic, the mammillae insignificant. The trunk is relatively
shorter.</p>

<p>The pelvis is higher and smaller. The circumference of the
hips is relatively smaller. The angle formed by the superior
plane of the pelvis with the horizon, when standing, is relatively
smaller. Hence the buttocks are less protuberant.</p>

<p>The limbs are longer. The forearm is more in a straight
line with the arm. The muscles are highly developed, hence
no traces of the pleasant rotundity of the female arm. The
hands are larger, the fingers thicker. The thigh is more columnar
and does not taper so rapidly as in woman. The obliquity
is less emphasized. The feet are larger and more sinewy. The
skin is of coarser texture, darker, lacking of smoothness and softness,
and is more hairy. The figure shows a lack of curves
through the paucity of the paniculus adiposus.</p>

<p>Man’s steps are longer, his gait is less swinging. Man’s
voice is vibrant and deep. Man’s respiration is of the lower
costal type.</p>

<p>Woman’s figure is ordinarily characterized by a relative
gracility, the forms are more delicate, the contours more rounded,
and the waist narrower than in man. The skeleton is more
delicate, the stature lower. The head is smaller and covered with
more hair. The hairs are luxuriant. The features of the face
are more delicately cut, the beard is wanting, the eyes are more
beautiful and lustrous, the cheeks are rounder, and the lips
daintily curved. The neck is round and long, lacking the
laryngeal projection. The chest is narrower, the shoulders sloping.
The hemispheric form of the breasts with the well-pronounced
mammilae render the bosom highly attractive. The
abdomen is longer, hence the distance between the navel and
the pubes is greater than in men. The pelvis is lower and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
larger than in the male, and surpasses the line of the shoulders.
The inclination of the pelvis is more pronounced, hence the
buttocks are more protuberant. The woman’s body thus seems
to be somewhat more reminiscent of the quadrupedal posture
than man’s. There is a greater obliquity and conicity of the
thighs. The calves are very pronounced. The skin, in general,
is of a finer texture, whiter, smoother and less hairy than in
men. The paniculus adiposus is abundant, hence the figure is
all curves and does not show the angles, as in man. The limbs
are relatively short, more delicate, more rounded, tapering and
less muscular than in man. The feet are smaller and more
daintily shaped. The hands are comely and the fingers slender.</p>

<p>The woman’s steps are shorter, her gait more graceful.
The woman’s voice differs in pitch as well as in timbre from
man’s. It has a higher note and sweeter tone. The woman’s
respiration is of the upper costal type.</p>

<div class="caption"><i>Fissiparous reproduction of the amoeba.</i><br />
The single-celled animal “a” is divided after different steps into two
animals, “f” and “g.”</div>
</div>

<p>The main function of the genital glands is the production
of germ-cells, the spermatozoa in the male and the ova in the
female. This production is effected by means of cell-division.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
The division may be direct as found in the fissiparous reproduction
of the amoeba. As soon as the cell reaches a certain
size, it divides itself into two cells. The more complicated form
of cell-division is the indirect division called “Mitosis” or
“Karyokynesis.”</p>

<p>As shown before the cell consists of two main parts, the
smaller part called the nucleus and the larger portion called
the cytoplasm. The nucleus shows in its interior a linin net and
deeply staining granules. Because of this quality they are called
“chromatin.” The cytoplasm in the close proximity of the
nucleus contains minute granules, situated either singly or in
pairs which are called “centrosomes.”</p>

<p>In the indirect division the nucleus is divided by a complicated
process. Simultaneously the cytoplasm and the membrane
are also cleft in two parts. In the typical cell division
two parallel series of changes occur nearly simultaneously, one
affecting the nucleus, the other the cytoplasm. The chromatin
which is usually (Fig. A, Cut XXVIII) in form of
scattered granules, arranged along the linin network, becomes
aggregated together in certain definite areas (Fig. B), forming
usually a convoluted thread or skein. This skein appears either
in form of a long filament or divided up into a series of segments
called “chromosomes” (Fig. C). The number of chromosomes
is constant for each species of plant and animal. Thus,
in the common mouse these chromosomes are twenty-four in
number, in the onion sixteen, in the sea-urchin eighteen, etc.
The number is always an even one. By this time the nuclear
membrane has disappeared, and the chromosomes appear usually
as a collection of bands lying free in the cytoplasm (Fig. D).</p>

<p>At the same time, another series of changes has gone
through the centrosome and the cytoplasm in the cell-body. The
centrosome assumes an ellipsoid form, constricts transversely into
a dumb-bell-shaped figure (Fig. B), and divides into two daughter
centrosomes. Around each of them is gradually developed
a stellate figure composed of a countless number of delicate
fibrils, radiating out in all directions from the centrosome
as a centre. The entire constellation is called “aster.” The
two asters grow in size progressively as the two centrosomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span><br /><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
move apart toward the poles of the cell (Fig. C). Between the
two asters a spindle-shaped system of delicate fibrils appears
stretching from one aster to the other which is called “central-spindle”
(Fig. D). The two asters together with the central-spindle
represent the “Amphiaster”.</p>

ch, chromosome; u, U-shaped loops; mf, mantle fibres; cf, connecting fibrils.</div>
</div>

<p>At this point the centrosomes or the asters and the chromosomes
begin to work together. A system of fibrils grows out
from each aster which attach themselves to the individual chromosomes.
The latter bent into U-shaped loops arrange themselves
in a circle around the centre of the spindle and form the
“equatorial plate” (Fig. E).</p>

<p>The chromosomes are now longitudinally split, and the
halves move toward the poles as if drawn by the mantle fibres
(Fig. F). The loops are still connected with each other by
these connecting mantle fibres (Fig. G and H).</p>

<p>The new U-shaped loops form now new skeins at each pole
(Fig. I). The chromatin granules now separate along the
thread of the linin network, and the new nuclear membranes are
formed (Fig. K).</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the forming of the two daughter nuclei
the cell-body constricts across the middle of the somewhat elongated
cell. The constriction increases until a complete division
in the equatorial plane of the spindle has taken place. The
result is the formation of two separate daughter cells (Fig. L).</p>

<p><i>Maturition.</i>—This mode of cell division is made use of by
the organism in the maturing of the germ cells into gametes.
Before the conjugation of the ovum with the spermatozoön takes
place, most ova extrude two polar bodies in the following way.
Twice a division of the ovum takes place, each time into two
quite unequal parts. The smaller, called polar bodies, remain
near the periphery of the egg cell and are extruded later on.
The same phenomenon is observed in the spermatocytes. The
immature germ cell can neither impregnate nor become impregnated
respectively, until, by a twice repeated cell division,
a part of the nuclear substance has been cast off. Only after
this has been effected does the germ cell become a gamete (a
marriageable cell, from the Greek word γαμέω, I marry), i. e., a
cell capable to impregnate or being impregnated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>This maturition of the germ cell has hitherto been veiled
in a mystery, which did not admit any plausible explanation.
Why is the loss of half of the chromosomes necessary? Nowadays
it has been accepted by most of the biologists that maturition
stands in close connection with Mendel’s law of segregation.</p>

<p>The learned monk Mendel, in his convent garden, made
several important discoveries concerning the heredity of living
organisms. He first discovered the quality which he called
“unit characters”. Unit characters are, in the first place, the
characteristics of the species, such as the number of the fingers.
Unit characters are further characteristic of the sex, as the beard
in the male and the breast in the female. Lastly there are the
individual unit characters, as black hair or blue eyes. Unit
characters are controlled by determiners which are either dominant
or recessive. Unit characters, for this reason, do not
blend. The color of the eyes, for example, is a unit character,
and black is the dominant color. Hence when a black animal
or plant is crossed with a white one, the hybrid is always black.
The black type predominates in the influence upon the hybrid,
while the type of white exercises the lesser influence.</p>

<p>The second phenomenon Mendel discovered is that of segregation.
By segregation is understood the separation of opposite
determiners. Every unripe ovum or spermatocyte in
the hybrid plant or animal, contains, for example, white and
black determiners, but the ripe ovum or spermatozoön contains
only one kind of determiner, either white or black, that
is, during the ripening of the germ cell into the gamete one
kind of the determiners has been eliminated.</p>

<p>Segregation, therefore, means that the gamete, or sex cell
after maturition, has either dominant or recessive determiners,
never both. Segregation thus affects the purity of the gametes.
The matured ovum and spermatozoön are always pure, even in
the hybrid plants or animals. Accordingly, when a spermatozoön,
with a white determiner impregnates an ovum with a
white determiner, although both originated in black hybrids,
the zygote, or the impregnated cell, will be a pure white. When
a black ovum is impregnated by a black spermatozoön, the
zygote will be a pure black. If the ovum is black and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
spermatozoön is white or the ovum is white and the spermatozoön
is black, the zygote will also be black, but a black hybrid.</p>

<p>
Black + black = black, 25% pure.<br />
Black + white = black, 25% hybrid.<br />
White + black = black, 25% hybrid.<br />
White + white = white, 25% pure.<br />
</p>

<p>Thus, when a black bean e. c. is crossed with a white bean, all
the offspring in the first generation will be black but hybrids.
When two of these hybrids are then crossed, the dominant color
black will be represented by 75 per cent. of the offspring and
the recessive color white by 25 per cent., i. e., the offspring in
the second generation, although both parents are black, will be
three-fourths black and one-fourth white. For the gamete of
two hybrid parents is always pure. The zygote of two hybrid
parents is either pure or hybrid. When the two gametes are
similar, the zygote is pure and is called homozygous, when the
two gametes are dissimilar, the zygote is heterozygous. Hybrids,
by the faculty of segregation, produce in the first generation
of hybridism, fifty per cent. homozygous zygotes (25% pure
whites and 25% pure blacks) and fifty per cent. heterozygous
zygotes (all hybrid blacks). Hence the apparent paradoxical
phenomenon that when a pure blond is married to a pure brunette,
all the children are brunette, while when both the parents are
brunette, but hybrids, the offspring will be twenty-five per
cent. blond and only seventy-five per cent. brunette. The blond
being recessive can only be pure, while the brunette being dominant,
may be either pure or hybrid.</p>

</div>

<p>This law, that the determiner in the protoplasm of the
parent cell, or rather in the nucleus of the cell, always fixes
the character of the progeny, holds good only of the unit character.
Many individual characters are fluctuations and play no
part in Mendelian heredity. Bodily modifications, resulting
from environing conditions, are not Mendelized. Most of the
human traits Mendelize, such as stature, span, size of head,
shades of color of hair and eyes, hair curliness, pulse rate, digestion
and the psychic traits, such as determination, cheerfulness,
alertness, resistance to fatigue. Some anomalies also depend
upon the determiners and Mendelize, such as colorblindness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span><br /><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
ness, night blindness, albinoism, brachydactylism (only two finger
joints instead of three), syndactylism, polydactylism, keratosis,
hemophilia, cataract, deaf-mutism, imbecility, Hutchinson’s
chorea, epilepsy, and some forms of insanity.</p>

<p>The Mendelian law of segregation has somewhat lifted the
veil in which maturition was wrapped. Every germ cell, being
a product of two parent cells, is in one way or other a hybrid.
By casting off half of the chromosomes during its maturing, it
becomes pure. The gamete is thus always pure and ready for
impregnation.</p>

<p><i>Impregnation.</i>—The process of impregnation is about the
same in most many-celled animals. As soon as the head of a
single spermatozoön enters the egg-cytoplasm, a new membrane
is formed around the ovum which effectually prevents the entrance
of any other spermatozoa. The head and the middle
piece penetrate now into the egg, the tail usually remaining
imbedded in the membrane where it soon degenerates.</p>

<p>A few moments after the spermatozoön has entered the
egg, a system of radiation appears around the middle piece
which develops into an aster, surrounding the centrosome of
the sperm cell (Cut 29, Fig. B.).</p>

<p>The sperm nucleus now increases in size, and its chromatin
changes into a reticulate form. Sperm aster and sperm nucleus,
the aster preceding, now move toward the egg nucleus. As the
nuclei approach each other the sperm nucleus increases still
more in size, until both become almost of the same size (Fig. C.).</p>

<p>The chromatin network of each nucleus now breaks up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
into a number of chromosomes and the nuclei come into contact
and fuse together. The centrosome, together with its aster,
divide now into two parts, and the two daughter centrosomes
move apart to the opposite poles of the ovum, and the typical
amphi-aster of cell division, as above described, is formed
(Fig. D.).</p>

<p>The nuclear membranes now disappear and the chromosomes
are drawn together into the equatorial plate where each
splits longitudinally. The halves are drawn by the mantle
fibrils toward the opposite poles where they are transformed
into two daughter nuclei (Fig. E.). In the meantime the cytoplasm
has also divided. The result are two new cells. This
process of division is repeated continuously in each of the
resulting generations of cells. From the mass of cells thus
formed develops the new organism.</p>

<small>THE FUNCTION OF THE MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS</small></h3>


<p><i>Testicles.</i>—The function of the testicles is threefold. There
is first the inner secretion of certain substances, spermines,
which are the cause of the male secondary characteristics.
Eunuchs who have been operated upon before puberty show
feminine traits in their appearance throughout their lives.
They have sloping shoulders, flabby muscles, beardless faces,
high-pitched, squeaky voices and festoons of fat on breasts and
hips. Secondly, certain stimuli starting from the testicles serve
to increase the tonus of the centres of erection. The main
function of the testicles is the production of spermatozoa.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

4, spermatocytes; 5, spermatids; 6, heads of spermatozoa.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Spermatogenesis.</i>—The testicles belong to the class of
tubulous glands. The tubules are through the greater part of
their course convoluted, tubuli contorti, toward the end they
become straight, tubuli recti. The wall of the convoluted
tubules consists of three layers, (1) an external connective tissue
layer, (2) a middle basement membrane, and (3) interiorly, an
epithelial lining. The epithelium consists of two kinds of cells,
first the supporting or the sustentacular or Sertoli’s cells and
secondly the glandular cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>When in activity, the glandular cells show three different
strata, which represent the three different stages of spermatogenesis.
The first stratum, the spermatogones, lie against the
basement membrane. They soon begin to increase by cell division
and move toward the centre of the tubule. During this
movement they increase in size and show the different stages
of mitotic division. These enlarged cells are called spermatocytes
and form the second stratum. The cells produced by the
mitosis of the spermatocytes constitute the third stratum and
are called spermatids.</p>

<p>During the transformation of the spermatocyte into a spermatid
a reduction of its chromosomes to one-half the number,
specific for the species, takes place. This reduction represents
the maturition of the sperm-cell, when the segregation of the
unit characters is effected. A spermatid is, therefore, already
a gamete, i. e., a reproductive cell in the reduced condition.</p>

<p>The spermatids are small round cells which line the lumen
of the seminiferous tubules. The spermatids soon become ovoid.
The nucleus forms the head, and the cytoplasm is drawn into
a tail-like processus. In this stage the spermatids are called
spermatozoa. A Sertoli’s cell, together with a group of developing
spermatozoa attached to its central end, is called spermatoblast.</p>

<p>The epithelium of the tubuli contorti thus consists of three
strata, first of the stratum of the spermatogones, lying against
the basement membrane, secondly of the stratum of spermatocytes
which are spermatogones in the state of mitosis, and
thirdly of the stratum of spermatids which are transformed
spermatocytes. The spermatozoa are spermatids which have
assumed their permanent shape.</p>

<p>The spermatozoön is divided into three parts, the head,
which is the modified nucleus of the male reproductive cell,
the intermediate segment, which is the cytoplasm of the cell,
and the tail, which is a veritable vibrating cilium, as found in
ciliated epithelial cells.</p>

<div class="caption"><i>Spermatozoön.</i><br />
a, head; b, intermediate segment; c, tail.</div>
</div>

<p>The spermatozoa soon detach themselves from the spermatoblasts
and wander into the seminiferous tubules toward the
rete vasculosum and epididymis. The spermatozoa possess their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
own motion. The head is propelled forward by a whip-like
wriggling of the tail. The rate of movement is 1.2 to 3.6
millimeters a minute. Water checks the movement and causes
the tail to curl up. Concentrated solutions of salts, sugar, albumen
and urea may revive the spermatozoa to former activity.
Metal salts and acids arrest the movements, while caustic potash
and soda invigorate them. Even thin and weak acid solutions,
as urine and the vaginal contents,<a id="FNanchor_C_3" href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">C</a> are harmful, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
alkaline solutions are favorable to the spermatozoa. In spermatozoa,
which have died gradually after ejaculation, the tail
is outstretched or slightly curved, while in those discharged
dead, the tail is rolled up in a spiral.</p>

<p><i>Seminal vesicles.</i>—The seminal vesicles have several functions.
The internal secretions serve directly as an excitans of
the sexual impulse. The distension of the vesicles reflectorily
stimulates the sexual centres. It is a well-known fact that
the distention of the vesicles in strict continence gives rise to
frequent erections, just as well as the full bladder, constipation,
lithiasis, and diseases of the prostate or of the rectum.</p>

<p>The main functions of the vesicles are three in number.
The vesicles serve, in the first place, as a reservoir for the
testicular secretions. The other function consists in the reabsorption
of the unejaculated sperma. The third function is to
furnish a fluid for the dilution of the very thick testicular secretion
and a medium where the spermatozoa can best carry out
their motions.</p>

<p>The seminal vesicles secrete a peculiar mucus, which is
thick, fibrinous, glairy, and albuminous. This secretion constitutes
the bulk of the semen.</p>

<p><i>Prostate.</i>—The prostatic gland has a double function. It
is the main point wherefrom the stimuli for the sexual impulse
start. The internal secretions of the prostatic parenchyma send
libidinogenous substances into the blood. The colliculus, rich in
nervous elements, sends also out nervous libidinogenous stimuli.
The principal function of the prostate is its secretion which
imparts to the otherwise sluggish spermatozoa their lively
movements.</p>

<p>The secretion of the prostate is thin, milky, translucent,
amphoteric or slightly acid. It contains the base spermin which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
causes the peculiar seminal odor. The secretion gives to the
inert spermatozoa their peculiar motion and life.</p>

<p><i>Cowper’s glands.</i>—The Cowper’s glands secrete a mucous
albuminous fluid of alkaline reaction. The secretion takes place
before the ejaculation of the semen.</p>

<p><i>Urethral glands.</i>—The urethral glands secrete a viscid
clear fluid. The secretion of these glands, together with that
of Cowper’s glands, serve first as a lubricant for the walls of
the urethra. The other function is to neutralize the contents
covering the urethral walls. The latter are ordinarily bathed
in acid urine. This acidity would harm the spermatozoa.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Semen.</i>—The semen is composed of the secretions of the
testicles, seminal vesicles, prostatic gland, Cowper’s glands and
the urethral glands. The semen is a thick, colorless, gelatinous,
opalescent, non-transparent, viscid fluid, resembling boiled
starch. It possesses a specific odor sui generis, due to the
presence of phosphate of spermin. Its specific gravity is higher
than that of water, its reaction is alkaline. It is soluble in
water and acids, and is coagulated in alcohol. If it is let
stand in a test tube, two layers will be formed, a lower one
opaque, consisting of spermatozoa and other cellular elements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and an upper one turbid and translucent, with only a few cells
and detritus. The two layers are of about equal thickness.</p>

<p>The semen consists of about ninety per cent. water and
ten per cent. solids. Of the solids sixty per cent. are organic
substances, thirty per cent. earthly phosphates, and ten per cent.
sodium chloride. When a drop of fresh semen is observed
under the microscope, it is found full of motion, as if an anthill
had been stirred up. This motion lasts for about twelve
hours. It is caused by the living spermatozoa. The number of
spermatozoa in an ordinary emission, of about ten grammes,
is about two hundred to three hundred millions. Besides the
moving spermatozoa, there are found a certain number of
lecithin globules. Their size is about half the size of a red
blood corpuscle. When semen is let stand for a certain time,
Boettcher’s crystals, consisting of phosphate of spermin, are
formed from the base which gives to the semen its peculiar
smell and which is derived from the prostatic secretions. The
semen also shows the presence of different kinds of epithelia,
the pavement epithelia from the fossa navicularis urethra, the
round cells from the prostate, and the columnar epithelia from
Cowper’s glands.</p>

<p><i>Erection.</i>—The male sexual activity consists in the essential
features, intromission and ejaculation. For intromission
erection is an absolute necessity. The lumen of the vagina is
only virtual, there is no real lumen. It follows that only an
unflexible body could penetrate into this organ, where the semen
has to be deposited for the production of the new being. For
this reason, it is prerequisite to copulation that the penis, which
is normally in a state of flaccidity, should obtain the required
rigidity. This rigidity is gained in the following way.</p>

<p>The tonus, which is present in all the blood-vessels of the
body, is the cause that the arteries of the corpora cavernosa
penis have only a virtual and not a real lumen. For between
the layers of the circular muscular fibres of these vessels is
found a layer of longitudinal fibres which narrow the lumen
and almost entirely compress it.</p>

<p>When the tonus relaxes, the blood precipitates into the
enlarged vessels and the cavernous spaces, and an active in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>crease
in the amount of arterial blood is the result. Through
the increase of the lumen of the arteries and caverns, the veins
are compressed and the blood cannot flow out of the cavernous
bodies. Thus the active increase of arterial blood serves as a
check of the reflux of the blood through the veins by the pressure
of the distended arteries and caverns upon these veins.
Besides this check, the vena profunda cummunis, by which the
blood of the corpora cavernosa penis has to return, passes
through the unstriped muscular fibres of the musculus transversus
perinei profundus. Now, this muscle contracts synchronously
through the same influence of the nervi erigentes which
caused the relax of the tonus in the arteries. The contraction
of the muscle causes the compression of the vena profunda and
prevents the blood from flowing off. Besides the muscular
transversus perinei, the musculus ischio-cavernosus which arises
from the os ischii and encircles the radix of the penis, as well
as the musculus bulbo-cavernosus by compressing the bulbus
urethrae will, both, at their contraction, prevent the blood from
flowing off. In this way there is not only an active increase
in the amount of arterial blood, but also an abrupt decrease in
the amount of venous blood, flowing out of the penis. The
corpora cavernosa, therefore, become of almost cartilaginous
hardness, and the penis reaches the state of rigidity, necessary
to the performance of the male sex-act. When erection is complete
the contraction of the musculus erector penis draws the
organ up against the abdomen and gives it the same direction
as that of the vagina.</p>

<p><i>Colliculus.</i>—With the erection of the corpora cavernosa, the
colliculus also swells and almost fills up the entire lumen of
the prostatic urethra. In this way the bladder which has already
been closed by the contraction of the sphincter, is closed
up more tightly, so that not a drop of urine could escape. The
erection of the colliculus also causes the orifices of the ejaculatory
ducts to take the direction forwards toward the pars membranacea.</p>

<p><i>Urethra.</i>—At this stage the urethra obtains an actual lumen.
Through the net of veins which surround the mucous membrane
of the urethra and through the turgescence of the corpus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
cavernosum urethrae, the canal of the urethra opens and remains
gaping through the entire duration of the erection. In
this way it is admirably fitted to give a free passage for the
semen. In the mean time the urethral glands are constantly
secreting their viscid clear fluid, which, together with the secretion
of the Cowper’s glands, provide a lubricating and protecting
coat for the urethra and neutralize the contents of the
urethral walls which are otherwise bathed in acid urine.</p>

<p><i>Ejaculation.</i>—The last important step of the male sexual
act is ejaculation. The spermatozoa leave the lining of the
tubuli contorti and wander through the tubuli recti to the rete
vasculosum and hence through the vasa efferentia to the head
of the epididymis. They continue their wanderings through the
epididymis and vasa deferentia until they reach the seminal
vesicles and the ejaculatory ducts. During sexual tranquility
and in a normal state of health, the ejaculatory ducts, owing
to the narrowness of their diameter and the oblique direction
of their orifices, are sufficiently compressed to prevent the semen
from reaching the urethra. The semen, therefore, remains in
the seminal vesicles until needed for ejaculation. If not needed
in due time, it is, as a rule, reabsorbed, and the overflow, if
there be any, is discharged during sleep, accompanied by libidinous
dreams.</p>

<p>Coincident with erection the entire situation changes. Before
ejaculation the testicles are forcibly drawn up to the
external rings of the inguinal canal, by the action of the
cremaster muscle. Through the contraction of the epididymis
and the coni vasculosi, the seminal fluid is propelled toward
the vasa deferentia. Through the peristaltic movement of the
vasa deferentia and the seminal vesicles, the semen is pressed
into the ejaculatory ducts. The latter, by means of the muscular
layer in their walls, forward the semen to the prostatic
urethra. The action of the ducts is at this moment facilitated
by the changed direction of their orifices. The change takes
place through the turgescence of the colliculus. The swelling
of the colliculus and the contraction of the external sphincter
of the bladder prevent the semen from flowing backward into
the bladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>At this stage the muscular substance of the prostate contracts
and squeezes out the prostatic fluid into the urethra. The
fluid had been stowed up in the follicles until there was a demand
for it. All these secretions of the testicles, seminal vesicles,
and prostate, meet synchronously in the prostatic urethra and
are there temporarily stowed up.</p>

<p>The muscular layer which surrounds the membranous portion
of the urethra is a veritable sphincter, the contractions or
dilatations of which will propel or retain the semen. The
semen pouring from the ejaculatory ducts and the secretion of
the prostate are steadily forced forward. But, retained by the
contracted sphincter externus, the semen is forced into the bulb
of the urethra, as the place of least resistance. In this way the
bulbous part of the urethra becomes distended and serves as a
temporary reservoir for the semen before ejaculation. By reflex
excitation, this distention causes spasmodic contractions of the
musculus bulbo-cavernosus and clonic contractions of the accelerator
urinae. The contractions of these two muscles overcome
the contractions of the sphincter, i. e., the muscular layer
of the membranous portion of the urethra, and the semen
is driven forward and gushes out of the meatus, in several jets,
through the open and well-lubricated canal of the urethra.</p>

<p><i>Nervous control of erection.</i>—The mechanism of erection
and ejaculation is controlled by six centres, the three cerebral,
one in the medulla oblongata, and the two spinal. Erection may
be caused by the stimulation of the cerebral centre of voluptas.
Impressions originating in the brain, as sexual thoughts, may
evoke vigorous erections. There is no function of the human
economy over which the mind exerts a more powerful influence
than over that of sex. The imagination, says Hammond,
is always a more potent stimulant of sexual desires than the
physiological incentive supplied by nature. Besides by imagination,
the cerebral centre may be excited by impressions conveyed
through the senses. Sight, smell, hearing, and in some
pathological states even taste are well known to convey sexual
stimulation to the brain. The sense of touch has such an influence
over the generative function that it is considered the
inseparable companion of sexual activity.</p>

The broken lines designate centripetal nerves, the solid lines denote

</div>

<p>Erection may further be stimulated by excitation of the
centre in the spinal cord. The direct electrical excitation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the spinal cord in dogs evokes vigorous erections. The irritation
of the spinal cord in some spinal diseases often produces
erections. Sleep, while lying on the back, is known to produce
vigorous erections, by increasing the flow of blood to the spinal
cord and by allowing the blood to settle in the medulla oblongata
and in the cord, so as to produce a passive congestion.</p>

<p>Erections may finally be evoked by the stimulation of the
peripheral nerves at the genitals as on the glans and on the
skin of the penis. Especially the prostatic urethra and the
colliculus are recognized as the most sensitive area, the focal
point of the nervous impressions on the genital system. Pressure
of the metal sound on the prostate or its cauterization,
tumors, calculi and inflammations, e. c., gonorrhoea, may often
excite erections. The prostatic mucous membrane is supposed
to be the seat of the pleasurable sensations. During any kind
of sexual activity, the prostatic area is intensely congested, and
its nerves are in a high state of tension. Excitations at the neighboring
parts of the genital organs, as evoked by hemorrhoids,
stone in the bladder, full bladder, worms or full rectum, may
also produce erections.</p>

<p>The peripheral excitations of the genitals are transmitted
to the central nervous system, i. e., the centres in the pons
and in the medulla, by reflex action. From these centres the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
stimulus is conveyed to the centres of erection in the lumbar
region. If the individual is in a state of unconsciousness as in
sleep, the stimulus at the periphery takes the direct road to
the centre of erection. The excitation of this centre is then
carried by the way of the nervi erigentes to the corpora cavernosa.</p>

<p><i>Centre of inhibition.</i>—All the nervous elements, the cerebral
centre of voluptas or sex-desire, the spinal centre of
erection, and the nerves at the periphery, not only at the genitals,
but the nerve endings of the skin through the entire body,
work in perfect harmony. Hence a man in full vigor of virility
would have vigorous erections at the slightest touch or even
sight of a comely woman. Given our present mode of life,
with the ubiquitous opportunities for such sights at all times,
normal healthy men would have to walk around on the streets
in a state of permanent priapism, but for the cerebral centre
of inhibition. The influence emanating from this inhibitory
centre works upon the spinal centre to prevent erection. When
the influence of this centre is removed, erection is facilitated.
When the spinal cord of a dog is severed in the lumbar region,
the irritation of the genitals more readily provokes erection.
With the removal of the inhibitory influence during sleep, the
least excitation of the genitals causes vigorous erections. When
the stimulation of the inhibitory centre is unusually increased,
as in neurasthenics and other nervous disorders, erections fail to
appear, when they are most desired.</p>

<p>Thus, by the inhibitory action of the brain, the tonus of
the centre of erection preserves the equilibrium, and it requires
longer preparations and more intense excitations than is ordinarily
furnished in social intercourse to evoke erections, necessary
for the performance of the sexual act. When cerebral inhibition
is removed, as in sleep, erections are facilitated. On
the other hand, when the inhibitory influences are increased,
as in a state of intense mental occupation or of depressing
emotion, as fear of inability to consummate the act, or fear
of detection, or at the loss of the object of one’s affections, or
in cases of extreme modesty or disgust, etc., erections may be
prevented or entirely arrested. Hence the normal accomplishment
of the sex-act requires complete absence of doubts, appre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>hensions,
of any anxiety whatever, and want of confidence in
one’s own power. Otherwise the inhibitory influences will prevent
a perfect erection.</p>

<p><i>Centre of ejaculation.</i>—The centre of ejaculation has its
seat in the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. In a state of
perfect health, the excitability of this centre is much lower than
that of erection. Hence it requires more intense stimuli and
longer preparation to produce an ejaculation than an erection.
The best stimulus for this centre is the tender, soft, warm vaginal
mucosa, when rubbing against the glans and the skin
of the penis.</p>

<p><i>Orgasmus.</i>—The complicated reflex nerve phenomena taking
place in a complete and perfect male sexual act may be
described as follows:</p>

<p>At the first voluptuous thrill of a physical pleasurable sensation,
and at the first tactile excitation of the sensual organs,
the cerebral centre of inhibition is at once paralyzed and its
influence is removed. The centre of erection has now opportunity
for the full display of its vasodilatory influences. The
tonus of the genital vessels is removed, and an increased amount
of blood flows into the arteries and caverns so as to render the
penis stone hard. Through the increased blood supply and
under the greatly increased nervous tension, the genital glands,
the testicles, seminal vesicles, and prostate secrete an increased
amount of their respective fluids. These secretions pour into
the urethral bulb and distend the same. The excitations, radiating
from this distension, serve to stimulate the centre of
ejaculation, and the contractions of the muscles bulbo-cavernosus
and accelerator urinae take place. The result of these contractions
is the phenomenon of ejaculation.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the ejaculation, the nervous tension,
which was increased to the highest degree through the excitations
of the different organs, is also removed. This explosion
of the nervous tension during the crisis produces the pleasurable
sensations which are known under the name orgasm<a id="FNanchor_E_5" href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">E</a> (from
the Greek word ὀργᾶν, to swell with lust).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>After ejaculation and the removal of the genital congestion,
the paralysis of the inhibitory centre ceases, and the normal
nerve tonus of the blood vessels gradually reappears. The influx
of blood into the genital vessels is thus cut off, and the erection
of the corpora cavernosa ceases. Only the colliculus remains
yet swelled, for some time. For this reason micturition is impossible
immediately after ejaculation. After the act follows a
state of exhaustion, weariness, weakness and inclination to sleep.
Although the frantic condition and the semi-delirium generally
lasts a short time only, still it is sufficiently long to exhaust
completely the strength of the ordinary organism. After a
certain time of rest, sex connection in a healthy person is followed
by a joyous feeling and fresh vigor. The head feels more
free and easy, the body more elastic, and a greater disposition to
physical and intellectual labor results.</p>

<small>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS</small></h3>


<p><i>Functions of the ovary.</i>—The ovary is lined by a layer of
genital epithelia (“Keimepithel”), which undergo certain
changes during the entire sexual life of the woman. The epithelia
are continually transformed into ova. When a single
genital epithelium leaves the ovarian lining to be transformed
into an ovum it moves from the periphery toward the centre.
It then surrounds itself with follicular epithelia and forms the
Graafian follicle. Through its growth the Graafian follicle approaches
again the periphery. All ripe Graafian follicles are,
therefore, situated near the periphery of the ovary.</p>

<p><i>Ovulation.</i>—About once a month a general congestion of
the entire genital system takes place.<a id="FNanchor_F_6" href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">F</a> This congestion causes
an effusion of serum and blood into the Graafian follicle and
the rupture of the same. In this way the ovum is set free and
is seized by the fimbriae of the Fallopian tube. The ovum begins
now its journey towards the uterus. During its progress through
the oviduct the maturition of the ovum, or the reduction of its
chromosomes to half the number peculiar to its species, takes
place by a double segmentation. The ovum is divided, twice in
succession, each time into two quite unequal parts. The smaller
segments, called polar bodies, remain near the periphery of the
ovum and are extruded later on. The ovum is now ripe for
fertilization.</p>

<p>According to Bischoff and Hiss, the impregnation takes
place in the distal end of the tube. After impregnation the
zygote continues its wandering by the current of the ciliated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
epithelia of the tube, towards the uterus. The ovum needs, according
to Hensen, from three to five days, according to Bischoff
eight days, to transverse this way, in the woman. It could not
last any longer, says Von Winckel, because the uterine end of the
tube, in the human female, has a diameter of only two to three
millimeters, while the diameter of the ovum, in the second
week of pregnancy, is three to six millimeters already. Hence,
when a retardation, for one cause or another, takes place, a
tubal pregnancy will be the result.</p>

<p>When the impregnated ovum has reached the cavity of the
uterus it penetrates through the epithelium into the submucous
fibrous tissues of the uterus, where it completes its development.</p>

<p><i>Internal ovarian secretion.</i>—Besides the function of preparing
the ova, the ovary has an internal secretion which is
the cause of the female secondary characteristics. When both
ovaries are removed before puberty, the time when the stamp
of sex is becoming impressed on every part of the body, the
essential feminine features fail to develop. The absence of the
ovaries leads to the development of a colorless, neuter creature
of angular form, strident voice, striding gait, and even of
bearded chin.</p>

<p><i>Function of the Fallopian tubes.</i>—The function of the ducts
is to furnish a path for the ovum in its passage towards the
uterus and for the spermatozoa on their way to meet the ovum.
The current of the tubal ciliated epithelia is directed towards
the uterus. In this way the ovum which does not possess self-motion,
as do the spermatozoa, is carried towards its destination,
while the spermatozoa have to swim against the current.</p>

<p><i>Menstruation.</i>—The main function of the uterus is to serve
as a couch or resting place for the fertilized ovum during its
development. For this end a wound has to be set in the lining
of the uterus to facilitate the grafting of the fertilized ovum,
just as the gardner makes a slit for ingrafting the young shoot.
The preparation of the ingrafting of the young animal is accomplished
by the monthly changes in the uterus preceding
menstruation. The monthly general congestion of the genital
organs, necessary for the ovum to leave the Graafian follicle,
also causes the uterine mucous membrane to swell from one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
to three millimeters in the thickness.<a id="FNanchor_G_7" href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">G</a> The mucosa becomes
thus turgid and velvety. The epithelial cells of the endometrium
swell and multiply. The openings of the uterine glands
are enlarged, and a whitish, opaque mucus is poured out. The
glandular cells are enlarged, and there is a multiplication of the
round cells of the stroma. The cells are cloudy and filled with
fat granules. This fatty degeneration involves the glandular
cells, the cells of the inter-glandular tissue, and the cells of the
blood vessels which are distended with blood. The endometrium
or lining is thus prepared for the reception of the impregnated
ovum. These alterations develop independently of the haemorrhage.
The swelling begins a long time before the period and
reaches its maximum only at this time.</p>

<p>If the ovum has become impregnated it is ready to respond
to these preparations. If, however, nature’s attempt to repro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>duce
an individual of the species has been frustrated, and the
ovum has not been impregnated, the latter has to be cast out,
and all the preparations are eliminated. The exuberant epithelial
cells are exfoliated. The delicate capillaries, engorged
with blood, sweat drops of blood by diapedesis or burst and discharge
their contents. The congested and engorged glands secrete
and excrete profusely.</p>

<p>This mingled mass of epithelial cells, blood and mucus
leaves the body in form of menstrual discharges. Menstruation,
therefore, is a retrograde process, in consequence of the failure
of the impregnation of the ovum. The monthly flow is like
the shedding of the leaves by the tree, the getting rid of some
material the function of which has been frustrated and for which
the economy has no more use.</p>

<p>Menstruation is thus the manifest phenomenon of the retrograde
metamorphosis which ensues at the failure of the ovum
to become fertilized. Where there is fertilization there is no
menstruation. Hence, those women who marry immediately
after menstruation sets in, at puberty,<a id="FNanchor_H_8" href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">H</a> and are impregnated
and those women who are impregnated immediately after they
finished nursing their babies, will seldom show the phenomenon
of menstruation. This is the reason why menstruation is so
rarely observed among animals.<a id="FNanchor_I_9" href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">I</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p><i>The concubitalis function of the uterus.</i>—Another highly important
function of the uterus is to serve as an organ of copulation.
During the orgasm, at the moment of the highest excitement,
the uterus descends deeper into the small pelvis.<a id="FNanchor_J_10" href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">J</a> It
is assisted in the descent by the pressure of the abdominal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
muscles. The uterus, usually flattened in the sagittal direction,
assumes a round, pear-shaped form during the orgasm and for
some time afterwards. In this way a real cavum uteri is produced,
and through the vacuum thus produced, the uterus is able
to suck in the semen by means of aspiration. Furthermore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
through the excitation, the circular fibres of the cervix contract at
the same time as the longitudinal fibres. The result is a dilatation
of the cervical orifice. The formerly flat opening becomes
round. At the same time the uterine orifices of the tubes, which
are generally closed, open widely and challenge the entrance of
the spermatozoa.</p>

<p><i>Female ejaculation.</i>—The contraction of the cervical fibres
also causes the erection of the vaginal portion and of the neck
of the uterus. This erection, at the moment of the highest orgasm,
serves to expel Kristeller’s slimy plug from the cervix.
This expulsion represents female ejaculation. After the expulsion
the cervix becomes soft and flabby. The erection and sudden
relaxation of the cervix cause the external os to open,
sometimes to the extent of fully three centimeters, and to make
several successive gasps. Each time the gasp draws powerfully
the external os into the cervix and causes the aspiration of the
semen.</p>

<p><i>Function of the vagina.</i>—The function of the vagina is to
serve as a receptacle of penis and semen. The erectile tissue
which runs along the entire length between the different membranes,
forming the vaginal wall, helps the vagina to adjust
itself to the volume of the penis and to augment its turgescence.
The muscular fibres, situated within the tunica media of the
vaginal mucous membrane, contract during the ejaculation of
the semen. The contraction is of a peristaltic nature, starting
from the vaginal aperture. In this way the semen is stowed
toward the uterine orifice under a certain pressure and is prevented
from flowing off.</p>

<p>Previous to this contraction the sphincter cunni, the analogous
muscle to the musculus bulbo-cavernosus in the male, also
contracts and clinches the penis, pressing, at the same time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
upon the two bulbs of the vestibule. In this way the vaginal
orifice is more firmly compressed.</p>

<p><i>Function of the Bartholinian glands.</i>—Through the activity
of the constrictor cunni, the Bartholinian glands are also
compressed. Normally these glands are inactive. They only
secrete on irritation.<a id="FNanchor_K_11" href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">K</a> At the first voluptuary thrills, the lubricating
fluid gushes forth from the Bartholinian glands, moistens
the sexual organs, prepares the way for the painless entrance of
the male organ and furnishes the ante-orgastic libido which is
second only to the orgasm itself, and is the only libido experienced
by many women throughout their lives.</p>

<p>The alkaline lubricating fluid from the Bartholinian glands
serves the further purpose of neutralizing the vaginal contents
which are of an acid reaction. But for the alkaline secretions,
before the male ejaculation, the spermatozoa would be killed
by the acids, or, at least, checked in their movements. The
secretion of the Bartholinian glands has, therefore, a threefold
purpose: it facilitates the frictions, neutralizes somewhat
the vaginal contents, and increases or furnishes the ant-orgastic
libido.</p>

<p><i>Function of the clitoris.</i>—The most sensitive organ of the
female genital apparatus is the clitoris. In the female child the
clitoris, analogous to the penis in the male, represents the main
erogenous zone, and its activity manifests itself by frequent
twitchings and erections. After puberty the main function of
the clitoris is, according to Freud, to transmit the stimuli to
the other genital organs.</p>

<p>The erection of the clitoris is produced in the same way as
the erection of the penis, by the relaxation of the arteries of the
corpora cavernosa of the clitoris, which are thus filled with
blood. The erection is further helped by the contraction of the
muscles ischio-cavernosus and constrictor cunni. The clitoris
has a direction, inverse to that of the erected penis, namely,
downward. By virtue of its direction and its angle, the erected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
clitoris is able to yield and descend to meet the dorsal face of
the glans and body of the penis, without being in a position
to rise again during its action. The contraction of the two last
named muscles will, therefore, help to press the right-angled
clitoris on the dorsal side of the penis. The erection and the
bending of the clitoris are further helped by the action of the
bulbs of the vestibule which, through the pressure of the penis,
send their fluid to the corpora cavernosa and the glans of the
clitoris and thus increase the sensitiveness.</p>

<p><i>Ordo rei.</i>—According to the functions of the different
organs, the initus muliebris takes the following course. As
soon as the mentula reaches the vestibule, the glans of the
clitoris is pressed down to the vaginal edge of the orifice of
the vagina to meet the glans fascini. Under the influence of
the erotic irritation, the tonus of the blood vessels of the corpora
cavernosa clitoridis and of the bulbs is removed, and the organs
fill with blood. The erected clitoris, bent down and pressing
upon the dorsal surface fascini, is thus unable to rise again.</p>

<p>At the first touch of these sensitive organs, the lubricating
fluid gushes forth from the Bartholinian glands, moistens the
vaginal orifice, and prepares the way for the painless entrance
fascini. The glans fascini passes now the two edges of the
vaginal bulbs, et collum corpusque fascini are seized by the
protruding parts of these bulbs. The constrictor cunni now
clinches the vaginal orifice, and the vagina, by means of its
erectile tissue, adjusts itself to the volume mentulæ. At the
moment of the male ejaculation a peristaltic contraction of the
vagina takes place, by which the sperma is stowed toward the
uterus and is prevented from flowing off until the female ejaculation
has taken place.</p>

<p>In the meantime the uterus descends deeper into the small
pelvis, and its muscles open the three uterine orifices. The secretions
of the cervical glands, or Kristeller’s plug, are now expressed
through the open external os, and a suction of small
amounts of sperma into the cervical canal ensues. The expression
of the cervical secretions represents the female ejaculation
and takes place at the moment of the highest orgasm.</p>

<small>LIBIDO SEXUALIS</small></h3>


<p>During the entire sexual spasm, especially at the height
of the venereal crisis, certain pleasurable or lustful sensations, or
libido, are experienced by both mates. The quality of the libido
is different in different individuals. In some people the pleasure
may be excessive, furious, overpowering. Some people are
thrown by the violence of their emotional manifestations in a
state of syncope or convulsions.<a id="FNanchor_L_12" href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">L</a> Hence the speculation whether
the quality of sexual libido is higher in the male or in the
female is entirely futile. Libido being a subjective feeling, no
one will ever be able to measure the same in another individual,
just as he is unable to measure the amount of pleasure his
fellowman has gained at any other occasion of enjoyment (e. c.
banquet, dance, theatre, etc.). Hence, we will never be able to
decide about the quality of libido in the two sexes. But the
symptoms of libido being in both sexes almost identical, the inference
may be drawn that the quality will also be similar.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of libido.</i>—The normal libido and orgasm show
certain defined symptoms by which the presence of the larger
lust may be easily diagnosed. While in libido corpora conjugum
are in a state of excitement, caused by the irritation of the
fibres of the sympathetic nerves. The irritation spreads over
the entire extent of the vasomotor system and causes a paralysis
of the vasomotor nerves. The result is the widening of the
coronary arteries, hyperaemia of the heart muscles, and
hence an increased excitation of the heart ganglia and palpitation
of the heart. The circulation is accelerated, the arteries
beat strongly, and the venous blood, arrested in the vessels,
augments the animal heat. The stagnation of the blood, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
pronounced in the brain by contraction of the muscles of the
neck and the retraction of the head, causes a momentary cerebral
congestion. During its continuance the intellectual faculties
are held in abeyance. The eyes are markedly injected, the
bulbi of the eyes protuberate, and the pupils are enlarged almost
twice their normal size. The eyes become haggard, and the sight
is dimmed, or the eyes are spasmodically closed in order to shut
out light. The respiration is rapid and panting, coming in
short and quick intervals, the air being expelled spasmodically.
Some times the respiration is entirely suspended by a convulsive
contraction of the larynx, and the breath is ejected in the shape
of babbling, incoherent words. The congested nerve-centres communicate
only vague and confused outside sensations. Mobility
and sensibility are held in suspension. The limbs are convulsively
agitated or are subject to clonic contractions. The nostrils
are dilated, the jaws are firmly set, and the teeth are ground one
against the other.</p>

<p>These different expressions of the summa libido are accompanied
by caressing words. Ovid, the master in matters of sensuality,
sings in his “Ars Amandi”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Nec blandae voces jucundaque murmura cessent</div>
  <div class="verse">“Nec taceant mediis improba verba jocis</div>
  <div class="verse">“Adspicies oculos tremulos fulgore micantes</div>
  <div class="verse">“Ut sol a liquida saepe refulget aqua</div>
  <div class="verse">“Accedent questus, accedet amabile murmur</div>
  <div class="verse">“Et dulces gemitus aptaque verba joco.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Where these symptoms are wanting, the absence of the
potency of experiencing libido may be assumed.</p>

<p><i>The orgasm.</i>—Simultaneously with the objective phenomena
of erection and ejaculation, runs the course of the subjective
pleasurable feelings. The libido may be divided into
three phases: the ant-orgastic, orgastic and post-orgastic phases.
During the ant-orgastic stage, the lustful sensation grows by
degrees in intensity up to the moment of commencing ejaculation.
The libido remains then relatively constant for some
time. The largest lust swells then suddenly to the maximum
and reaches its acme, the orgasm, at the instant of emission.
After the ejaculation the libido disappears rapidly. It falls to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
zero and is followed by a phase of indifference and in some
individuals even of depression. In the female the pleasurable
feelings occur later than in the male, come on more slowly, and
generally outlast the act of ejaculation. The female post-orgastic
libido does not rapidly disappear, as in the male, but
dies away as the tune of the tuning-fork.<a id="FNanchor_M_13" href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">M</a></p>

<div class="caption"><i>Curve illustrating the course of the orgasm.</i><br />

</div>

<p>After the orgasm the sexual excitement gives place in the
male to a state of exhaustion and to an inclination to sleep,
and to a comfortable feeling of lassitude in the normal woman.
“Omne animal post coitum triste est praeter mulierem gallumque,”
says Galen. After a few moments rest a comfortable
lassitude takes possession of the whole body in both mates.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Cum pariter victi faemina virque jacent.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At this period, even if the man would be in a position ad
pergendam commixtionem (e. c. eunuches and in priapism),
further permulsiones are not wanted and their discontinuance
is demanded by the normal woman.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Aspiciem dominae victos amantis ocellos</div>
  <div class="verse">“Langueat et tangi se vetet illa diu.”</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>
<p>A woman desiring the continuance of uninterrupted penetrations,
or who even allows them, plainly shows that, while she
may have felt ant-orgastic libido, she has surely not experienced
the supreme gratification which is found in the state of orgasm.
Except in early youth, and then only after a protracted continence,
it is impossible even for a woman to experience further
libido immediately after the orgasm. The general notions about
the great feminine potency are erroneous. They are based upon
the confusion of the potency of cohabitation with the potency
of experiencing the orgasm, which is not one and the same
even in the male. So far as cohabitation is concerned it is true
that the weakest, most delicate woman, is able to tire out the
strongest man. Playing the passive part, she could stand concarnatio
continua for a long time, in fact, as long as the
mucous membrane of the vagina will last, and the vaginal pavement
epithelia are by nature very strong. Even Ovid knew
this fact. He says in his “Ars Amoris”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Conteritur ferrum, silices teneantur ab usu</div>
  <div class="verse">“Sufficit et damni pars caret illa metu.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But in regard to the potency of experiencing libido the woman
is generally inferior to the man. After three complete orgasms
in one night even a young, strong woman will be completely
enervated during the following day, and the woman who regularly
experiences a daily orgasm, for a protracted period, will,
no less than her active partner, fall a victim to neurasthenia
after some time.</p>

<p><i>Intensity of libido.</i>—The intensity of the pleasure varies
in different individuals. With some the intensity reaches a
very high degree. There are those who cry and bite at the
height of orgasm.<a id="FNanchor_N_14" href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">N</a> On the other hand, there are individuals
who scarcely have any lustful feelings, or, if capable of experiencing
ant-orgastic libido, are lacking in the feeling of orgasm.
Normally the intensity of libido and orgasm increases with the
number and dignity of the points which produce the pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>The source of any kind of pleasure lies in the five senses.
Of these the sense of touch is best adapted to provoke sexual
pleasure. The tactile sense is the fundamental and generic sense
from which all others take their rise, and by which they are
verified. All the perceptions of our senses have to be supplemented
by our tactile sense. The foetus, within the uterus,
receives the first knowledge of its own individuality, of its own
ego, by the tactile sense. In touching with its body the wall
of the womb, it receives one impression, while in touching one
part of its body with another part, it receives two impressions,
at both points of contact. In this way it learns by repeated
experience of the existence of bodies outside of his own. Thus
it differentiates its own ego from the outside world by the sense
of touch, at a time when the other senses could not as yet
functionate. Touch is, therefore, the primary sense. The other
senses are only modified tactile senses. Waves of sound touch
the tympanic membrane of the ear: rays of light touch the retina
in the eye; odors touch the nerve-endings of the olfactory nerve,
and food the taste-papillae.</p>

<p>The sense of touch is, therefore, the sense above all others
to evoke pleasurable sensations. The touch of a soft and smooth
surface pleases; that of a rough object displeases. Many people
like to feel smooth objects, such as velvet. Others prefer smooth
plants; yet others are fond of caressing animate beings, such
as cats or dogs with a smooth fur. There are those who delight
to touch the soft, smooth skin of babies. Now the softest and
smoothest skin in the human body is found on the parts covered
with a mucous membrane. The pleasurable sensations,
therefore, increase when two individuals touch each other at
parts covered with such a membrane. Hence, kissing on the
lips, by reason of their covering, is accompanied by pleasure.
This undoubtedly accounts for the origin of kissing.</p>

<p>The same reason is responsible for the universal tendency
among lovers to approach and touch one another’s lips. For,
affection fed by sight, sound, taste and odor, reaches its climax
in touch. The combined power of contact with softness and
warmth amounts to a considerable pitch of material pleasure,
and a predisposed affection, as among lovers, renders the contact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
thrilling. Love pleasure, therefore, begins and ends in sensual
contact. The intensity of the sensual pleasure will be proportional
with the area of contact and with the dignity of the
organs touched. Nudity with the greater area of direct contact
will increase the pleasure.</p>

<p>The values of the organs producing sexual libido are successively:
in the male, glans et corpus penis, scrotum, labia
oris, lingua, palma manus, and the gluteal region; in the female,
clitoris, vulva, labia majora, nymphae, vestibule, vagina, vaginal
portion of cervix, mamillae, labiae oris, lingua, palma manus
and the gluteal region.<a id="FNanchor_O_15" href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">O</a> The more points of the highly sensible
organs are touched, the larger the extent of the skin-surface
that enters into the realm of touch, the more the frictions
are conducive to excitation, the better the function of the sphincter
cunni,<a id="FNanchor_P_16" href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">P</a> the greater will be the intensity of the sensual
libido in both mates. If more special senses are excited, such
as sight by beauty, the smell by sweet odors, the touch by soft,
smooth skin, if imagination coöperates, and if inhibitory effects
are absent, then the intensity is much greater.</p>

<p><i>Inhibition of libido.</i>—The inhibitory effects upon the libido
have various causes, and are mostly brought on by the different
senses. The most inhibiting effects emanate from the sense
of smell. The sense of smell plays an important rôle in provoking
or inhibiting sexual desire. For that reason women are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
possessed of certain odors to attract their mates.<a id="FNanchor_Q_17" href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">Q</a> The vaginal
mucus, or rather contents, have a stale, characteristic odor.
This odor belongs to the class of the capryl-odors, which may
be designated as the specifically erotic odors. The natural
vaginal odor becomes stronger during the menstrual period.
Some women transpire at the time of menstruation the disagreeable
odor of trimethyl-amin.</p>

<p>In some country-districts in Europe, it is reported, the
young peasants, when going to a dance, place their handkerchiefs
into their arm-pits to imbibe the peculiar odor of the
man, and, unaware to the girls, hand over the same to the
women they are in love with to smell. The peculiar odor is
supposed to excite the girls to love.</p>

<p>All this serves to show that the quality of the odor is not
a matter of indifference to the excitation of sexual voluptas.
The disagreeable smell from any part of the body of one mate
will act as an inhibition upon the libido of the other. The
sense of sight, if offended, works much the same way. Ugliness
will, therefore, act as a check not only upon the voluptas, but
also upon the libido. Pain or cold have also inhibitory effects.
Hence defloration, accompanied by more or less pain, checks the
libido of the woman.</p>

<p>Hatred has a great inhibitory influence upon voluptas and
libido. In men, it is self-evident that where there is no voluptas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
there is no erection and consequently no congress or libido. But
even in women where sexual conjugation is possible against
her will, libido can seldom be compelled. She may be debauched,
physically, and even ejaculation may take place, for when fully
excited, the muscular contractions become independent of the
will, but the excitation can not induce full libido.<a id="FNanchor_R_18" href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">R</a> Virtually,
a woman can rarely be violated. If in a case of rape the woman
experiences complete orgasm, then she consented physiologically,
though she may have morally struggled against the impropriety
of the act.</p>

<p><i>Spatium concarnationis.</i>—Spatium temporis concubitus,
to a certain extent, depends upon the will. The man and
the woman are able to delay the orgasm for a certain time.
It is in the individual’s power, if it be not neurasthenic or
tabetic, to induce the orgasm earlier or later. But this power is
limited. It is not altogether voluntary to induce orgasm or
prevent it.</p>

<p>The duration varies in different animals as well as in different
individuals. In some animals a single stimulant suffices
to induce orgasm; other animals remain in conjugio for
hours or even days. If the duration of the ant-orgastic stage
is too short in the female, analogous to the ejaculation ante
portas in the male, the deficiency must be corrected. Though
the precipitate orgasm in the female has not the same importance
as in the male, because her orgasm does not of necessity terminate
congressum as in the male. Yet it may, sometimes,
have a damaging effect upon the potency of procreation. For
the ideal intercourse, in the interest of procreation, is the one
in which the female ejaculation occurs immediately after the
male emission or simultaneously with the same. Besides, the
longer duration creates greater intensity of libido, which is desirable
for the well-being of both mates. For this reason Ovid
advises in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> “Ars Amandi”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Crede mihi, non est veneris properanda voluptas,</div>
  <div class="verse">“Sed sensim tarda prolicienda mora.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>The post-orgastic stage.</i>—Soon after the orgasm the libido
ceases, and a state of languor ensues.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Cum pariter victi faemina virque jacent.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In normal individuals and in affectionate lovers the lassitude
is of an agreeable nature. The serenity of the mind depends
largely upon the intensity of the experienced libido. If
the act is executed with great pleasure, it will give the nervous
system a pleasurable excitement and will act as a helpful tonic
upon the nerves. The blood under its animating influence flows
more freely through the capillary vessels of the skin. The countenance
becomes expanded, its expression brightens and its whole
surface acquires the ruddy tint and genial glow of health. Every
function seems to be gladdened by the tonic. It causes a universal
expansion of vital action. The body feels buoyant and
lively, and there is a consequent disposition to quick and cheerful
muscular motions, as running, jumping, dancing, laughing,
and singing. Furthermore, the act executed with a great intensity
of pleasure serves to appease the sexual desire for a time
and naturally leads to moderation. The serenity and well-being,
following such an act, have a great influence upon the continuance
of the lovers’ affections. An agreeable calmness will
increase and even create attachment. Some conventional marriages
turn for that reason into affectionate love-affairs.</p>

<p>If the intensity of the libido is insignificant, a depression of
the mind post concarnationem will result. Where coition is
performed with aversion, without affection for the mate or with
fear of infection or conception, it will act as a nerve-depressor,
and a state of dejection will be the result. Such an act does
not satisfy and appease the sexual desire. Like a distasteful
meal that does not satiate, concubitus without pleasure or
great affection creates desires for more sexual indulgences, keeps
the nerves in a state of sexual excitement, and leads to many
kinds of debauchery. Even if originally a good deal of affection
existed, a sexually unsuitable match may reduce the intensity
of the libido to a minimum. If then the languor is disagreeably
felt, if the individual remains excited and is unable to sleep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
and the following morning feels enervated, the former affection
will gradually disappear, and a romantic love-affair of long
duration may turn out a complete failure after marriage.<a id="FNanchor_S_19" href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">S</a></p>

<small>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX ATTRACTION</small></h3>


<p>A law regulating and governing phenomena is only possible
on the assumption that the law is the expression of the modus
operandi of the governing power which has established the fixed
rules for the performance of a certain action leading to a certain
end. The law governing the phenomena of sex has evidently
been prescribed for the purpose of the preservation of the
species. This preservation is at the basis of sexual desire, and
because the ultimate aim is unknown to the agent, the desire is
instinctive in nature. For every instinct is an inward impulse,
an unconscious, involuntary prompting to action, without a distinct
apprehension of the end which nature has designed should
be accomplished thereby. Hunger for love and hunger for food
are both based upon the two instincts of preservation, the instinct
of the preservation of the individual and the instinct of
the preservation of the kind.</p>

<p>The hunger for food, manifested already by the new-born
baby,<a id="FNanchor_T_20" href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">T</a> is based upon the instinct of the preservation of the indi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>vidual,
the sex-urge, manifested by youths and maidens at the
time of puberty, before they have ever experienced any copulative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
libido, is based upon the instinct of the preservation of the species.
The active principle of the mind, which is energetically devoted
to the gratification of the sensual desire and the state of mind
which is constantly yearning to satisfy the sensual want, are
the promptings of this instinct. They exist at this early period
independent of all experience. The absorbing feeling which
seeks the consummation of its purpose, as well as the selection
of the means to be employed, is not based upon previous experience.
They are internal, unconscious messages which give rise
to the conscious impulses, without waiting for the external
stimuli which, later on, coöperate with the impulse to affect the
nervous centres.</p>

<p>The conscious impulses, composing the sexual instinct, are,
according to Moll, the impulse of contrectation, or the desire to
effect a real or a virtual contact with an individual of the opposite
sex, and the impulse of detumescence, or the desire to
effect a certain material and nervous discharge. Any inclination,
to become an impulse, must possess two qualities: it must
move the individual to commit an act in which logic and calculation
have no part; and secondly, while committing the act, the
individual must be conscious of its immediate aim. The two
component impulses of the sex-instinct possess these two qualities.
They are unreasoning promptings to actions, the end of
which is present in the individual’s consciousness.</p>

<p><i>Impulse of contrectation.</i>—The impulse of contrectation is
the conscious desire of the individual to obtain a contact with
an individual of the opposite sex, if possible by the tactile sense
proper; if not, at least, by the visual or aural senses, or by the
imagery, by looking at a comely individual of the other sex,
by listening to its voice, or by thinking of the person. This
impulse is at the basis of the lovers’ desire to caress and fondle
each other. This impulse is entirely distinct from the desire
for sensual conjugation. It is found in children who have as
yet no knowledge of sex. An individual may have the wish
to touch an individual of the opposite sex, as for instance, in
a public conveyance or at a dance, without any thought of sex-congress,
and where sensual conjugation is entirely out of the
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>During the gratification of this impulse of contrectation
(from the Latin word contrectare, to touch with lust), a certain
tumescence (from the Latin word tumescere, to swell), or
congestion of all the organs of the body, particularly of the
genital organs, and an increased amount of nervous energy
throughout the entire organism, takes place.</p>

<p><i>Impulse of detumescence.</i>—At this stage the second component
of the sexual instinct, the impulse of detumescence (from
the Latin word detumescere, to diminish in swelling) comes
into play. Tumescence causes a certain oppression, and the individual
is impelled to cause a discharge of the material congestion
and a spasmodic relief of the nervous tension. The
procedure of this material and nervous discharge is specific.
The man’s impulse is “penem in vaginam intromittere et semen
ejaculare,” and the woman’s impulse is “membrum viri atque
semen in vaginam suscipere eodemque tempore detumescere.”
If the opportunity for the specific discharge is lacking, other
unnatural means for emission are employed, or the organism
rids itself of the oppression during the state of unconsciousness,
as in sleep. Ejaculation, hence, gives pleasure because it
relieves the mechanical as well as the nervous tension and causes
a change both in the blood and the nerve supply. Hence, the
impulse of detumescence is less a craving to gain a positive
lust feeling as the impulse of contrectation.</p>

<p><i>Children’s affection.</i>—The impulse of contrectation is already
met with in small children. The desire to effect a physical
contact is often observed among very small children. There
are some children who are even susceptible to sexual excitement,
but these are the exceptions, their emotions are pathological.
Normally there appears to be no erethism of the sexual organs
in children during the process of love-making. They have no
knowledge of the meaning of sex. With them the caressing
contact is an end in itself.</p>

<p>In the love-making of children we can distinguish two different
modes, according to the age of the child. In the first
period, between three and eight years of age, the child is perfectly
ignorant of the meaning of sex. Still it may indulge in
the pleasure of bodily contact with an individual of the opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
sex. During the second period, between eight to twelve years
of age, the children are aware of the difference and even meaning
of sex, still the erethism in the organs is still absent.</p>

<p>The presence of the emotion of love in children of the
first period is shown in many ways. Children of the opposite
sex fall in love with one another. They seek each other’s company.
They sit close to each other and indulge in kissing, embracing,
and lifting each other. They often present gifts to,
and make sacrifices for each other. Even jealousy is not absent.
The lover tries to monopolize the allegiance of the beloved one.
This love in early childhood is characterized by the absence of
shyness or of any sense of shame, which shows the complete
sexual anaesthesia.</p>

<p>With the appearance of shyness and modesty in children of
the second period, the love-making may be traced to the conscious
sex instinct. The instinct is manifested by the tendency
to conceal the love affairs. Modesty is a characteristic trait of
the young lovers. When in each other’s presence they feel embarrassed
and ill at ease. They appear awkward when left alone
to themselves. They try to avoid each other and may even
appear to the casual observer to hate each other. Especially
does the boy try to simulate resentment. The girl is, on the
whole, more aggressive in these early love affairs. The woman’s
innate love of being wooed comes to surface later on when she
has reached maturity. Yet even the boy’s emotions are discernible
by the keen observer. The emotions of infatuated children
may assume all the appearances of true love, with its joys and
sorrows. Yet any thought of the reproductive organs is entirely
absent.</p>

<p><i>Puberty.</i>—Before puberty the sexual activity of the child
consists thus in the desire and gratification of the impulse of
contrectation. This contrectation does not cause yet a state of
tumescence in the child, and without tumescence the impulse of
detumescence is also absent. The first state of spontaneous
tumescence is called into existence by internal messages.</p>

<p>At the time of puberty, the generative centre or the centre
of voluptas begins rapidly to grow and comes into increased
activity. The internal messages become then so frequent that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
they charge the entire body with a considerable amount of nerve
energy and cause in the generative organs a certain congestion,
stimulation and irritation. This spontaneous tumescence, produced
with the growth of the centre of voluptas in the brain,
is then the cause of calling to life the impulse of detumescence.
The individual has the strong desire to free itself of the material
congestion and of the nervous tension. In animals the impulse
of detumescence is, with a very few exceptions, identical with
the sex-instinct. Most animals have no desire for contrectation.
In man the impulse of contrectation is the more important. If
the individual practises total abstinence, i. e., if he abstains even
from the gratification of the impulse of contrectation, then the
state of spontaneous tumescence would return through the internal
messages, at certain periods, just as rut periodically
appears in the animal. As a rule, however, total abstinence from
the gratification of the impulse of contrectation, material or
mental, is very rarely or never found in the civilized adult man
or woman. Hence the state of tumescence in man is not given
the chance to reach its periodicity, but is always produced by
the gratification of the impulse of contrectation.</p>

<p><i>Mechanism of sex-activity.</i>—The mechanism of sex-activity
may thus be compared with the charging of a Leyden jar with
electricity. The generative organs must first be charged, like
the jar, with a certain material turgescence and with nervous
energy, in order to evoke the impulse of detumescence. The
comparison with the Leyden jar may be moved even a step
farther. Just as the charge of the jar with electricity is of a
longer duration, compared with the instantaneous discharge at
its contact with the earth, so is the charge of the organism with
nervous sex-tension usually of longer duration in comparison
with the short duration of the discharge.</p>

<p>During the gratification of the impulse of contrectation,
by imagination, look, word or actual contact, the organs are
charged with nervous energy and vital fluids. This charging is
connected with a certain kind of fore-pleasure and may last
considerable time, from a few minutes to several hours or even
days. The satisfaction of the impulse of detumescence when
the vital fluids and nervous energy is discharged by coition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
pollution or any other way, is of very short duration, normally
lasting a few minutes only. Sexual activity, hence, consists in the
charging and discharging of the vital fluids and nervous tension.
The sexual act and copulation are not synonymous. The
act begins with the satisfaction of the impulse of contrectation,
which comprises by far the greatest part of sex activity. Copulation,
on the other hand, represents only the final stage of the
drama and is of short duration.</p>

<p><i>Emotions of puberty.</i>—The state of tumescence is a necessary
condition of sexual gratification, and in ordinary life is
effected by contrectation, i. e., it is, as a rule, voluntarily produced.
The case is different at the time of puberty. At this
period, the tumescence is evoked by internal promptings.</p>

<p>With the beginning of pubescence, the stepping-stone between
the child and the man or woman, the secondary characteristics,
as beard, enlarged larynx, musculature in man, and
filling out and rounding of the body, development of the breasts,
enlargement of the pelvis in woman, are becoming noticeable.
It is the period of the rapid acceleration in the growth of the
centres of generation, and indefinable yearnings and moods,
wishes and fears assume domination of the growing child. Sweet
inexpressable emotions of wonder, awe, and amazement disturb
the thoughts and actions of the awakening consciousness. Mysterious
sensations, foretastes and impulses fill the heart of the
ripening individual. For the man it is the beginning of the
period of “storm and stress.” It is the time when the elemental
cosmic fire of love is bestowed upon the eyes of youth, and an
infinite yearning is implanted into his soul by an invisible power.
At the approach of this time, a tender fledgeling of longing is
implanted into the heart of the girl. She becomes quiet and
shy. She shows a shrinking timidity and coyly takes flight at
the least approach of him at whose sight her hungry emotions
are profoundly stirred.</p>

<p>With the increase in size and vigor of the generative organs,
the bodings of sexual desires and the cravings of the
natural instinct take possession of the individual’s thoughts
and fancy and awaken in him erotic ideas and lustful feelings
and the strong impulse for the organs to function.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>When the genital centres have been fully developed, the
individual gets a conscious realization of its sexual power, and
the psychological reactions of animal passion manifest themselves
in the irresistible desire for intimacy with an individual
of the opposite sex. This desire is inscrutable and transcendental.
There is no knowable reason for its existence present.
Ordinarily the idea of a desire is realized by bringing vividly
to the mind the memory of a former desire gratified. But at
this time the individual has not as yet had the experience of
carnal pleasure, neither is it conscious of the ultimate object of
the sexual instinct, the propagation of the species. Yet it is
instinctively drawn towards the person of the opposite sex, and
at its sight the hungry emotions are peeping through every
action. The individual’s nature is both chaste and voluptuous.
It is chaste because the individual has no knowledge as yet of
libido or lust, yet it is voluptuous, it is all-impulse.</p>

<p>The impulse of contrectation is the first to impress itself
upon the mind of the individual. With the intimacy, the impulse
of detumescence becomes also imperious, and the desire
to enjoy the full possession of the beloved object begins to
manifest itself. These are, then, the two desires the individual
is henceforth well aware of and which it is anxious to gratify.
The real purpose of the instinct of sex has been hidden to man.
Seldom or never is amativeness guided by the desire to propagate
the race. Sex-activity is chiefly desired for the satisfaction
of the sensual cravings.<a id="FNanchor_U_21" href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">U</a> The animal in its sex-relations
is largely or exclusively guided by the impulse of detumescence.
The same is the case with men in a low state of civilization, with
their promiscuous admiration of the opposite sex. What such
savages desire is a relaxation of the nervous tension and a discharge
of the genital congestion. In men of high culture the
impulse of contrectation is the more imperious, and mental
attraction is added as a factor in the love-game, i. e., civilized
men are more erotic than libidinous in their nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>The different phenomena appear in the just described order,
if no disturbances interrupted the natural course. If the individual
was allowed to reach adolescence without interference,
then at the period of puberty, when the centres of generation begin
to increase very rapidly, and the generative organs reach
their full development, a certain kind of material congestion
and nervous tension would ensue. But the congestion and tension
would be of slight intensity to require a specific discharge.
The absorptive power of the seminal vesicles and of the uterus
would easily master the increased secretions, or the overflow
would be discharged once or twice a month during sleep, mostly
without even awakening the sleeper. Such a frequency of nocturnal
emissions, especially if not accompanied by bad effects
the next day, are perfectly normal.</p>

<p>But in ordinary life natural development without disturbance
is rarely or never met with. Hence the sexual activities
take an entirely different course. Boys and girls are brought
up promiscuously in flats, in schools or on the streets. The first
component of the sex-instinct, the impulse of contrectation, has
an early opportunity to develop, even before puberty, as may
be seen in the early attachment of children. By the time puberty
is reached this impulse has been completely developed. The
opportunity for the gratification of this impulse is everywhere
present. Hence the tumescence is not evoked by internal messages
and natural promptings but through the actual contact.
With the beginning of the contact, be it in thought, look, word,
or touch, simultaneously also begins the sex-act. Having begun
the act it is natural and normal for the lovers to have it completed.
If the stimulation of the erogenous zones is prolonged
beyond a reasonable space of time without relaxation by an
emission, a sense of incompleteness and dissatisfaction will
ensue.</p>

<p>By some strange quirk of the human mind the error and
fallacy have been fixed, even among thinkers, that sex-activity
begins and ends with copulation.<a id="FNanchor_V_22" href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">V</a> The charging of the body
with the necessary energy is considered a negligible quantity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
We have taken out the final part of the act and elevated it to
a fetich, in law as well as in sentiment, and consider all other
sex activities as of no consequence. Yet the stimuli received
through the other senses, causing the libidinous turgescence of
the body, are the main part of the sexual chain of activities.
The sexual act begins with the amorous caress, be it a caress in
thought, look, or touch, as hugging or kissing. For contrectation
or tumescence and detumescence represent only one act. One
impulse is the sequel of the other. The Sermon on the Mount,
preaching, “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her
has committed adultery with her already in his heart” (Matthew
v, 28), is nearer the physiological truth than the common
accepted view.</p>

<p>The same disturbances which cause a break in the chain
of sexual activity during childhood, puberty and adolescence are
also responsible that in civilized men we can hardly speak any
longer of an instinct of sex. If the instinct has not been disturbed
by the intrusion of the stimuli of the senses and of the
imagery before the period of maturity, the instinct of sex should
enter into play at the time of puberty. But, as a rule, the
stimulation of the erogenous zones is effected already before the
time has arrived for the sex-instinct to make its appearance.
During this stimulation, which, as we have seen, is already a
part of the sex-act, a certain fore-pleasure is experienced.
Henceforth the individual is desirous of the repetition of this
experience. Especially when the orgasm has once been tasted,
the memory of the same causes the individual to look for a
repetition of the highest lustful sensation in human experience.
Sexual activity is henceforth chiefly desired for the positive
lust-feeling connected with it. This means to say that calculation
enters into the activity, and with the entrance of calculation
the activity ceases to be instinctive. Hence in modern men and
women neither sex-activity nor propagation partake of the nature
of an instinct. Normal sex-attraction being an offshoot of
the reproductive impulse, it is perfectly natural that if the
parent impulse loses its instinctive nature, the offspring will
also lose it.</p>

<small>DEVELOPMENT OF THE REPRODUCTIVE IMPULSE</small></h3>


<p>The instinct of propagation is normally derived from the
impulse for the satisfaction of protoplasmatic hunger. In
lower animal life the incipient sexual union is effected by two
exhausted cells coming together for the mutual exchange of
nuclear material. This mode represents the first step in the
scale of conjugation.</p>

<p>In the lowest form of unicellular life, as the schizomycetes
(yeast) or bacteria, the necessity for conjugation does not appear
to exist. In the reproduction of these unicellular organisms
the animal simply divides into two, the division of the
nucleus, as a rule, preceding that of the cytoplasm by a more
or less karyokynetic method.</p>

<p>The ordinary protozoon does not form a composite structure.
It divides and multiplies, but the products of the division
do not remain together, they leave each other and lead a separate
existence. Hence there is no real death in these animals. In
the metazoa, or many-celled animals, only the reproductive cells
may escape death and continue to live in the offspring. The
somatic cells, or the body, die after a longer or shorter period.
The unicellular animals do not possess any somatic cells, they
are all reproductive cells. Hence we may rightly speak of the
“immortality” of the protozoa.</p>

<p>The method of binary fission or splitting, by which the
body of the parent becomes divided into two equal parts, into
halves, is the simplest method of multiplication. This method
is made use of in the amoeba. In this kind of reproduction there
is no parent nor child. The children, the new amoebae, are
simply the parent cut in two (vide Page 60).</p>

<p>The next simple generation is budding, which is the breaking
off of a part smaller than half from a certain individual.
The budded-off part has the capacity of growing into a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
individual like the parent. This mode of reproduction is found
in the hydra.</p>

<p>Another simple mode of generation is that of sporulation.
Here the interior of the body of the individual subdivides into
more than two parts. Sometimes the parts number many hundreds
and are called spores. These three methods are the
simplest modes of generation and are exclusively found in the
lowest forms of unicellular organisms.</p>

<p>When we go a step farther, in the class of unicellular protozoa,
the simple mode of multiplication continues, in most
forms, only for a certain number of generations. Then the
necessity for conjugation, i. e., for a temporary or permanent
fusion with another individual, sets in. If this conjugation be
prevented, the animal soon degenerates and dies.<a id="FNanchor_W_23" href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">W</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="title">CUT XXXV.</div>
<img src="images/i_pg113.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Infusorium reproducing by sporulation.</div>
</div>

<p>The simplest terms of conjugation are found in Chilodon,
a minute fresh-water infusorium, which multiplies for a considerable
length of time by transverse division. After a time,
however, the physiological necessity for conjugation sets in.
The different animals place themselves side by side, in pairs,
and partly fuse together. The nucleus of each individual divides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
now into two portions, one of which passes from each infusorium
into the other to unite with the half of the nucleus that remained
stationary. The two animals then separate, each having received
a half of the nucleus of the other. Thereupon a period
of renewed activity for each ensues, manifested by rapid growth
and multiplication by division, until a certain weakening in the
vital activities indicates the periodically recurring necessity for
conjugation.</p>

<p>The next step in conjugation is found in those animals in
which after their fusion the two animals do not separate any
more, as found in the fission of monads, which is preceded by
the absorption of one form by another. One monad is fixed
upon the sarcode of another, and the substance of the lesser,
which is the lower one, passes into the upper one. In about
two hours the merest trace of the lower one is only left, and in
four hours fission and multiplication of the larger one has
taken place.</p>

<p>From these two modes of generation it is easily seen that
the impelling force leading to conjugation is, as Rolph puts it,
simply cell hunger. These modes of multiplication are also
found in the simpler forms of colonial protozoa,<a id="FNanchor_X_24" href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">X</a> where the cells
are not yet differentiated and all the members of the colony take
part in reproduction.</p>

<p>In the next higher class of colonial protozoa, the first differentiation
of the members or cells of the colony takes place.
One part of the cells is set apart to continue the task of reproduction,
while the main body of the colony does not participate
any longer in the function of generation. As a rule, the reproductive
cells are divided into two kinds, and these two kinds of
cells conjugate with each other. The conjugation takes place
either between different members of the same colony or between
members of different colonies of the same species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>The conjugating individuals are similar in the simpler
kinds of colonies. In the higher forms the two conjugating
cells are easily seen to be very different from each other. One
kind of cells is large, spherical and inactive. They are for
this reason called egg-cells. The other kind of cells is small,
with ovoid head and tapering tail and free-swimming. For this
reason they are called sperm cells.</p>

<p>When the differentiation between the reproductive cells
into two kinds has taken place, they are called sex cells. The
sex cells are usually situated in groups, and the groups are called
sexual glands. The groups of sperm cells are called testicles
and those of egg cells are called ovaries.</p>

<p>In the lower classes in the animal kingdom the male and
female glands are situated at different parts of the same animal,
or near each other. Sometimes the same gland is producing
both kinds of cells, male and female. In the hermaphroditic
species of round worms, for instance, it is found that, when the
reproductive organ is fully formed, it functions first as a testicle.
The germ-cells at the anterior end of the sexual gland begin
to divide rapidly and become small spermatozoa which are stored
up in a receptacle of the uterus. Later on other cells, also
situated at the anterior end of the sex-gland, begin to grow
larger, store up yolk and become large egg-cells. They then
enter the uterus and become fertilized by their own spermatozoa.
This mode of fertilization is the so-called self-fertilization. It
is found in the slightly complex animals, as the tape-worm or
the leech, where one and the same individual produces both egg-cells
and sperm-cells. In colonial jelly-fishes certain members
of the colony produce only sperm cells, and certain other members
produce only egg-cells.</p>

<p>In the hermaphroditic animals the sperm cells of the same
individual may fertilize their own egg-cells or ova, as in the feat-worm
(self-fertilization), while in the earth worm, although it
is also hermaphroditic, cross-fertilization takes place. Two
earth-worms mutually fertilize each other, the sperm cells of
one fertilize the ova of the other, and the sperm cells of the
latter fertilize the ova of the former.</p>

<p><i>Fertilization in plants.</i>—This mode of cross-fertilization is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the one generally found in phanerogamous (φανερός = apparent
and γάμος = marriage) plants.</p>

<p>In the lower forms of the organic world the line of demarkation
between plant and animal is somewhat blotted, and
the identity of the mode of fertilization does not need to be
particularly emphasized. In the higher forms the division is
generally made by the mode of the assimilation of food and of
motion. Plants generally break up the inorganic compounds
into separate elements and recombine them into organic compounds,
or potential energy. These organic compounds serve
then the animal as food or as source of energy. The inorganic
compounds being, as a rule, ubiquitous, the plants have hence a
certainty of food supply and do not depend upon the facility
of motion. They are, therefore, marked by a fixity to the soil.
They are also surrounded by an outer skeleton, or a coat of cellulose
and are less affected by outer stimuli; hence they possess
slight consciousness. For the animals the food-supply is more
uncertain, hence they need greater movement. For this reason
they generally lack the external skeleton and hence possess higher
consciousness.</p>

<p>Apart from this division plant and animal are closely related
cousins, and the mode of fertilization of most of the higher
plants is about the same as in the hermaphroditic animals.</p>

<p>The sexual organs of the phanerogamous plants are represented
by the flowers.<a id="FNanchor_Y_25" href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">Y</a> Showy flowers consist usually of four
sets of organs, pistils, stamens, petals, and sepals. The sepals
taken together constitute the calyx, the petals taken together
constitute the corolla.</p>

<p>The essential organs of the flower are the stamens and
pistils. The stamen represents the male organ, and the pistil
the female organ of the plant, while the calyx and corolla form
the floral envelopes, or the so-called perianth and are analogous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
to the external genital organs in the animal. Flowers which
contain all the four sets of organs are said to be complete flowers,
those which have the essential organs only are called perfect
flowers.</p>

</div>

<p>Complete and perfect flowers are hermaphroditic. The
male organ or the androcele and the female organ or the gynocele
are situated in one and the same flower. The unisexual flowers
are those where the stamens and the pistils are produced on
separate flowers, as in the willow. Stamen and pistil may not
only be produced on separate flowers, but the staminate and
pistillate flowers themselves may be borne on different plants,
as in hickory, hazel, or Indian corn. Such plants are called
dioecious or of two households. When both kinds of flowers appear
on the same individual, the plant is called monoecious
or of one household.</p>

</div>

<p>The stamen, or the male sexual organ of the flower, con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>sists
of a hollow portion called the anther, which is borne on
a stalk called the filament. Inside of the anther is found a
powdery or pasty substance called the pollen. The shape of
the anther and the way in which it opens depend largely upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the way in which the pollen is to be discharged and how it is
carried from flower to flower. As a rule, the anther opens by
the cells being split length-wise, or by little holes at the top.</p>

<p>The pollen in many plants is a fine dry powder, in others
it is somewhat sticky or pasty. The forms of the pollen grains
are various. Each pollen-grain consists of a single cell and is
covered by a thick outer and a thin inner wall or coat. At the
outer coat there are spots at which the inner coat of the grain
is finally to burst through the outer one, pushing its way out
in the form of a slender thin-walled tube. The contents of
the pollen is a thickish protoplasma, full of little opake particles,
and usually containing grains of starch and little drops
of oil.</p>

</div>

<p>The pistil, or the female sexual organ of the flower, usually
consists of a small hollow chamber called the ovary, which contains
the ovules, and of a slender portion or stalk, called the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
style. At the top of the latter is found a ridge, knob, or point
which is called the stigma.</p>

<p>The stigma consists of cells loosely arranged over the surface.
These cells secrete a moist substance, to which the pollen
grains adhere when they come in contact with the stigma. Beneath
these superficial cells, running down through the style,
there are found long cells, with intermediate spaces, through
which the pollen tube reaches the ovary.</p>

</div>

<p>The ovules are not borne indiscriminately by any part of
the lining of the ovary. They grow in a line running along
one side of the ovary, as may be seen in the pea pod. This
ovule-bearing line is called the placenta.</p>

<p>The ovule usually exists as a roundish or egg-shaped mass,
with a small opening leading into the apex. This opening
leads to a sac inside the ovule, which is filled with a soft protoplasmatic
material and cells and is known as the embryo sac.
Minute cells are found at the apex of the ovule from the de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>velopment
of which the embryo is produced, after the union of
the pollen with a cell at the apex of the embryo sac of the
ovule has taken place.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Fertilization.</i>—As soon as the pollen grain lodges on the
stigma, it begins to form into a pollen tube. In more or less
time it makes its way through the style into the ovary. It then
penetrates the opening at the apex of the ovule, reaches one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
the cells and transfers its nucleus into an egg-cell. The latter
begins at once to form cell-walls and increases by continued
subdivision to the plant embryo. Only one pollen tube is necessary
to fertilize each ovule. Still plants produce more pollen
than ovules—the ratio is from 1:8 to 1:1000—because so many
pollen are lost on their way to the ovules.</p>

<p>The mechanism of the forwarding of the pollen to the
ovule varies in different plants. In self-fertilization or in those
plants in which the ovule may be impregnated by the pollen
of the same flower, fertilization is comparatively easy. But in
a great many plants cross-fertilization is the rule. In order
to accomplish the most successful fertilization, the pollen must
come from another plant of the same species. Here nature has
devised different ways to carry the pollen from one plant to
another.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is the wind which accomplishes
the task of forwarding the pollen. The wind-fertilized flowers
have dry and powdery pollen, and the pistils are feathery,
adapted to catch flying pollen grains. The flowers are characterized
by their inconspicuousness. They are usually greenish,
without any odor or nectar.</p>

<p>Another device to forward the pollen is by way of insects.
Most of the showy, sweet-scented or otherwise conspicuous kinds
of flowers are entirely dependent for fertilization on the transference
of pollen from one plant to another by insects. The
showy colors and odors serve to attract insects to visit them for
their nectar. Insects and flowers are interdependent upon one
another. For many insects depend mainly upon the nectar and
pollen of flowers for their food. These insects usually visit
only one kind of flower during the day and thus carry only one
kind of pollen. Butterflies, moths, and most of the bees go
straight from one flower to another and carry a good deal of
pollen entangled in the scales or hairs of their bodies. On its
way, the insect leaves a good deal of the pollen on the stigma
of the pistil and becomes dusted with new pollen to be carried
to other flowers.</p>

<p>The means to attract insects are threefold: nectar, odor
and color. The nectar is a sweet liquid which the flower se<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>cretes
by means of nectar glands. The latter are usually
situated near the base of the flower. Other plants attract insect
visitors by giving up a sweet scent. These are especially the
small flowers, like the mignonette or evening primrose. The
color is another means by which the flower attracts insects and
birds. The color of the flower is, as a rule, due to showy
petals. Different kinds of insects are especially attracted by
different colors. Some flowers with very long tubulated corollas
depend entirely upon birds with long beaks to carry their
pollen for them.</p>

<p>In complete and perfect flowers, where stamen and pistil
are present in the same flower, self-fertilization would be the
rule, if there were not certain means for its prevention. In
the first place the pollen of another plant frequently prevails
over that which the flower may shed over its own pistil. When
both kinds are placed over the stigma, at the same time, it is
the foreign pollen which causes fertilization. Another means
to prevent self-fertilization consists in the stamens and pistils
maturing at different times. The insect visitor, on its way to
the nectary, brushes against the ripe stamens of a certain flower
in its earlier stage. It cannot deposit the acquired pollen upon
the stigma of the same flower and thus cause self-fertilization
because the pistil is not ripe yet. But, in flying to a flower
in the later stage, when the stigma has already ripened and
the stamens have shed all their pollen, the insect will lodge
the pollen first acquired on the ripe stigma, and in this way
produce the desired cross-fertilization.</p>

<p><i>Sex-differentiation.</i>—When we rise higher in the scale of
animal life we find that the egg-cells and sperm-cells are
almost always produced by different individuals. Those which
produce egg-cells or ova are called female, and those which
produce sperm-cells or spermatozoa are called male animals.
The formation of a new being results in these species from
the conjugation of two cellular elements of two different animals.
In this way the origin of the organism, or the zygote from which
the new individual develops is composed of parts of two different
individuals, and a difference between the offspring and parents
is insured. The intermixing of body-substance from two dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>tinct
individuals and the development therefrom of the new
individual produce variation.<a id="FNanchor_Z_26" href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">Z</a></p>

<p>When the scale of animal life is reached where egg-cell
and sperm-cell have their habitats in different individuals, the
attraction between ovum and spermatozoön, which is based upon
a kind of erotic chemotropismus, is transferred to the two hosts
who harbor the two different sex-cells. Thus the erotic chemotropismus
between two cells has now grown to sex-attraction
between two animals. But even at this stage the attraction
sometimes exists only between the sex-cells, namely when fertilization
takes place outside of the mother’s body. The best
example of outside fertilization are the fishes. The female fish
contains the roe, which is a mass of small eggs. At the proper
time the female lets the roe fall on the ground of rivers or
the dark bottom of lakes, etc., at a favorable place called spawning
bed, secure against enemies. The male fishes swim over
the spawn and pour their semen or milt over it. The two
kinds of cells attract each other like iron and magnet. When
the milt has reached the spawn, the eggs are fertilized and
develop into new fishes.</p>

<p>In the next higher class, in birds, fertilization is internal,
and only the development is external. The female bird has
an ovary containing a large number of eggs or ova, within its
body. The male animal possesses an organ serving for the introduction
of the semen into the body of the female. The
fertilized egg is laid and develops outside, either by the sun-heat
or hatched by the mother’s warmth.</p>

<p>The last step in generation is reached in the mammals.
Here not only fertilization is accomplished within the body
of the female, but also the entire development of the fertilized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
ovum is carried out in the uterus, inside the female body.
Hence mammals give birth to living mature young.</p>

<p>In these higher animals the attraction of the sex cells has
been definitely transferred to, or rather changed into, the attraction
of the hosts of these cells or into the sexual instinct. The
sex-instinct is, therefore, if not identical with the instinct of
propagation, thus an offshoot of the latter instinct.</p>

<p>In the more advanced species of the higher animals the
instinct relating to the preservation of the kind is composed
of three definite impulses. There is first the impulse relating
to the act of conjugation, universal in all organic life. The
average individual grows up surrounded by others of the opposite
sex and normally unexcited by this difference until the
age of puberty approaches. Then some day, the boy or girl
find arising within an incipient impulse which, naturally, were
there no artificial restrictions, would lead them to exercise their
sexual powers, just as found among animals.</p>

<p>The second impulse relates to the pursuit and attraction
of mates. It is first found among the lower types of the animal
kingdom. The sweet odors and showy colors found in flowers
are nothing else but the means of attracting the insects that
carry the pollen for fertilization. The bright colors of some
animals, especially among birds, and other animal adornments
also serve to attract the mates. The woman’s love for finery
also emanates from no other source than from the impulse of
pursuit and attraction of mates.</p>

<p>The third impulse stands in relation to permanent mating
and the protection of the young. It is the impulse relating
to the germs of family life, and is present among those animals
that have gained a higher place in the ascending scale of complexity
and whose young are more difficultly provided for.<a id="FNanchor_AA_27" href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">AA</a></p>

<p>Through the whole range of animal life, where the period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
of infancy is comparatively short (e. g. horse, dog, cat, etc.),
the male part is ended with impregnation or copulation. The
nursing of the young is left to the female,<a id="FNanchor_AB_28" href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">AB</a> and she will sacrifice
her own life in the protection of her breed. In animals
whose young are not easily provided for (e. g. fox, wildcat,
eagle, sparrow, pigeon, stork, etc.), not only the mother will
sacrifice her own existence in the protection of her offspring,
but also the father will do his utmost in the interest of his
young ones. In these animals the males remain attached to
the females they have secured at the first period of oestrum
even after the time of propagation has passed, provide mutually
for their offspring until the latter can provide for themselves,
and at each succeeding period of rut, yield again to love and
never seek a new mate until the old one dies. Ernest Thompson
Seton found that hawks practise monogamy and that
wolves consort for life, and, in case of death, the survivor remains
alone. The Canadian wild goose, when it has lost its
mate, will never seek another. Thus the instinct of permanent
mating or of monogamic marriage, is a phenomenon already
found among many animals.</p>

<p>Now, among all animals, the prenatal period and the period
of the maternal feeding are almost the longest in man. The
helplessness of the human infant is unique among the creatures
of the animal kingdom. The new-born baby is devoid of nearly
all instinctive capacities, except the taking-in and assimilation of
food. It is unable to stand or wander in search of food. It
is nearly blind and deaf. It is perfectly naked, without fur or
feathers, and hence is in need of a certain amount of heat,
being injured by the least draught. It is in need of the utmost
cleanliness, still it is unable to keep itself clean. It is
unable to fast longer than a few hours. In short, the human
infant is the most complete picture of helpless dependence.
Hence without the help and strength of fatherhood, afforded to
motherhood, the human race could not have survived the primi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>tive
stage, when couples still lived separated. The length and
feebleness of human infancy required a union of male and
female of considerable duration. By the time the last child
was able to emancipate itself from the parental protection, the
period of sexual activity had been passed. Permanent mating
among men, especially in the prehuman stage, was a condition
sine qua non, all the preachings of the free-lovers to the contrary
notwithstanding.<a id="FNanchor_AC_29" href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">AC</a></p>

<p>Permanent mating is, therefore, a natural impulse among
human beings. It is necessary for the protection and preservation
of the lives of a lesser number of offspring of a higher
grade. Permanent mating is, hence, of fundamental racial
value. In man this impulse is of a more complex form and
broader range, which leads the individual to wish not for
momentary excitement, but for a permanent union, for a home,
for a family. Even to the man who regularly indulges in
meretricious venery there comes a time when these bonds of
mere passion do not satisfy any longer. He begins to crave
for a permanent mate and a home. This impulse appears later
in life and is not present in the earlier impulse for mere conjugation,
arising at the period of puberty. The amatory feelings
at that time of life are bestowed upon the first pleasing
individual of the opposite sex and are seldom of long duration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
They are transferred from individual to individual. Later in
life, after character is formed, there comes for men and women
the dawn of a deeper affection, which involves bonds of stronger
form and more permanent type than any that mere passion
can arouse. This unconscious and involuntary craving for a
permanent mate and home is of an altruistic nature. It has
been wisely implanted in the interest of the race. There is
nothing egotistical connected with this impulse. Personal gratification
does not enter into consideration, for the joy and pleasure
connected with personal satisfaction may be found with
any temporary mate.</p>

<small>SENSUAL LOVE</small></h3>


<p>Permanent mating is altruistic in character, but the altruism
extends only to the future generation. Even the fastidiousness
found in permanent mating is in the interest of the unborn.
The mates are only tools in the hands of the commanding
Spirit, whose all-governing principle has only one thought,
only one prosaic aim, the propagation of the human species.
The attachment between both mates cannot, therefore, be properly
called love. For in love the mate is of primary importance.
But the permanent-mating impulse is the stepping-stone
to love which is first found in the human race. In human
love a distinction must be made, according to Finck, between
two different kinds; love as an instinct, or sensual love<a id="FNanchor_AD_30" href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">AD</a> and
love as a sentiment, or sentimental love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>Sensual love is the only kind of love the greater part of
humanity knows.<a id="FNanchor_AE_31" href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">AE</a> This love has no depth or duration, and
when satisfied, cares no longer for the object for which it
temporarily hungered. For when sense forms the chief part
of the compound feeling, love will not long survive possession.
There may be a strong individual preference in sensual love.
The charm exuding from the personality of one individual may
possess a kind of personal magnetism for another of the opposite
sex. The luscious intoxicating essences, exhaling from
one person, may have a particular idiosyncratical attraction for
the other. Hence sensual love may be as fastidious as pure
love. It may temporarily focus its interest on one person only.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Yet in sensual love the intense desire for exclusive possession,
the jealousy toward rivals, the coy-resistance, and the moods
of doubt and hope are only emanations of selfish lust, of eagerness
to gratify an appetite with a particular victim for whom
the lover has no adoration or self-sacrificing devotion. Such
a lover loves only himself; his one object is to please his own
beloved “I,” without any regards for the feelings of his mate.
The latter figures only as a means to the end, that end being
his own gratification. To such a lover, “I love you” means “I
long for you, covet you, and am eager to enjoy you.” All indulgences
and favors shown to the mate are only meant as
means to gain a certain end, and when this cannot be attained,
sensual love will change into the contrary passion of hatred.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
In sentimental love such a thing as hatred is impossible. For
to understand a thing thoroughly, forever puts that thing beyond
the pale of hatred; to love a thing merely is to subject
oneself to the possibility of hating that thing.</p>

<p>Sensual love, says Duboc, starts as an ideal notion and
fancy from the sensual enjoyment which the sexual feeling
promises. Whoever promises to satisfy to perfection appears
as an ideal, by being the representative of this enjoyment; he
becomes the object of the highest wish and desire. But as
soon as he loses this significance, this symbol of sexual union,
he immediately is deprived of his ideal character. By no means
can, therefore, sensual love renounce, because with the resigna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>tion
and renunciation the deposition of the ideal immediately
begins, while true love can only prove its genuineness by the very
renunciation.</p>

<p>Sensual love is thus characterized by the egoism that lies
at its foundation. Joy and sorrow, hope and fear, which may
be found in sensual love, are only the selfish aspects of passion.
The moods of hope and despair may disquiet or delight also
those who love only as a carnal appetite. A desire which is the
most violent and the most engrossing of all passions, a craving
which next to hunger and thirst is the most powerful and imperious
of all appetites may cause all kinds of selfish pleasures
and selfish pains. Even attachment and fondness are no proof
of the existence of pure love. The manifestations of attach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>ment
may spring from selfish interest, they may be the rewards
for favors to come. Fondness, displaying a silly extravagance
or unseemly demonstrativeness, does not prove true love; it may
be only a foolish, doting indulgence. The old maid is also
fond of her dog and the little girl of her doll. Some men love
their wives as children love dolls, and, as a natural result, treat
them just as dolls are treated. They dress them in all the
finery they are able to procure, pet and exhibit them until they
become old, and then they turn aside for their neighbors’ dolls.
Even the doll’s admired beauty is valued not for the pure
artistic delight of loveliness, but as an incentive to the chase.
This is not true love. The person is here only valued as an
object without which the beloved “ego” could not have its
selfish indulgence. Even adoration is no proof of true love.
Husbands are often adored for their coldness, hardness, arrogance
and contemptuousness, and beaten wives do often most
warmly adore. Yet such husbands are certainly not truly loved.</p>

<p>Fondness, liking and attachment even to the degree of
committing suicide upon the loss of the person coveted, may
not be true love withal. Suicide is no test of true love. Many
a man commits suicide after losing his wealth, yet money is
not loved for its own sake, but for the power it possesses of
procuring the means for enjoyment. A person may take his
own life because it feels lonely after the failure to secure the
desired union. An individual may risk life and comfort to
obtain possession of a coveted body for its own enjoyment.
Such actions are no indication of genuine love and, generally,
they prove just the contrary, just as the unrestrained, unlimited
desire which ignores all considerations of honor, prosperity
and peace, does not prove true love but, on the contrary,
the urgings of the primal instinct. Neither should the sacred
term “true love” be applied to the feeling that animates selfish
and impulsive idiots to assassinate cowardly an unresponding
mate. Such designs just prove the selfish lust. The gross,
sensual infatuation which leads a man to shoot a woman who
rejects him, or which leads a woman to throw acid in the face
of the beloved man, is absolutely antithetic to refined, ardent,
sentimental love, which impels the lover to sacrifice his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
life and comfort rather than let any harm come to the one
beloved.</p>

<p>This true love is only possible among the refined and cultured.
Hence the greater part of humanity has never known
the emotions of sentimental love. The only love it knows is
sensual love.<a id="FNanchor_AF_32" href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">AF</a> Men and women with blunt intellects also have
blunt feelings and are incapable of experiencing true love.
They can only be inspired by the love of the body. This love,
to be sure, is not necessarily coarse or obscene, yet it is a
stranger to true sentimental love.</p>

<small>SENTIMENTAL LOVE</small></h3>


<p>Sentimental, or true love, is a conscious altruism and is
the antithesis of the egotistic sensual love. Before applying
the term true love to the relation of both mates, the test of
disinterested affection, as found in the instinctive parental love,
must be applied. The distinction between sensual and sentimental
love is the selfish desire of libido in the former and the
self-sacrificing ardor of altruistic affection in the latter.</p>

<p>The two emotions have some characteristics in common,
and for that reason, sensual love is, as a rule, mistaken for
sentimental love, even by the greatest thinkers and best poets.
An essential and invariable ingredient in sentimental, as well
as in sensual love, is the imperative desire for an absolute
monopoly of the beloved person. But while in sensual love this
desire springs from an egotistic source, selfish elements are
foreign to this desire in sentimental love. The latter knows
only devotion and sympathy, which urge the lover to seek the
welfare of the one beloved, if need be at the expense of his own.</p>

<p>The only true index of genuine love lies, therefore, in the
sacrifice of one’s own happiness for another’s sake. Pure love
is always ready to lose its own life in an effort to save another’s.
The sentimental lover is, indeed, not less overjoyed to have his
affection returned; but if it is not reciprocated, his love is,
unlike sensual love that turns into resentment, none the less
affectionate. He never slakes his thirst with the blood of his
beloved, even if he is rejected. His constant solicitude is how
he can make the beloved happy and save the adored person
from grief, at whatever cost to his own comfort. He feels the
joys and sorrows of his beloved, as if they were his own. He
has completely surrendered himself and his own peculiarity to
the other and has, in a certain respect, died as something specific
and individual.<a id="FNanchor_AG_33" href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">AG</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>True love, therefore, was slow in coming and is a child
of a higher civilization, and is, even then, known only to the
cultured. Only when humanity has reached that state of civilization
when men and women show not only their respective
physical but also mental secondary characters, then admiration
and respect enter into the relation of the sexes. Love becomes
more and more fastidious and more regardful of intellectual
worth and moral beauty, and sentimental love is made possible.
For true love cannot exist without respect, and genuine affection
is chiefly evoked by intellectual, emotional and moral qualities.</p>

<p>The secondary mental characters in the man are strength,
hardiness, robustness, courage, aggressiveness, activity, creativeness,
stern justice, gallantry, generosity, manly will, manly
grace, tenderness, and intelligence. The feminine qualities are
gentleness, kindness, patience, tenderness, benevolence, sympathy,
self-sacrifice, meekness, sensitiveness, emotionality,
modesty, demureness, coyness, and domesticity. The highest
phases of genuine love are possible only where the secondary
psychic qualities are highly developed. Such persons do not
care to possess in the low, coarse way that characterizes sensual
love. They are content to love and be silent, to worship even
at a distance.</p>

<p>Love, says Horowicz, growing up as a mighty passion from
the substratum of sexual life has, under the repressing influences
of habits and customs, taken on an entirely new, supersensual,
ethereal character, so that to the true lover every
thought of naturalia seems indelicate and improper. True love
is, therefore, only possible between refined and cultured people,
between a man capable of adoration, sympathy and affection
and a woman equipped with mental and moral charms. In
true love the woman must show the same traits as in her
maternal capacity. She has to be a real mother to the man
she loves. The man starts life at a woman’s knees, and it is
to a woman’s knees that he returns when he marries. Woe to
him and her, if the second woman’s love is less selfish and
sacrificing than that of the first.</p>

<p>A sympathetic disposition is as essential to the individual
who wishes to be loved truly and permanently as all the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
secondary psychic qualities. Cruel indifference is not incompatible
with sensual love, but it is fatal to love based upon
sentiment. Ordinary, sensual infatuation could be strong and
unprincipled enough to lead a person to sacrifice honor and
self-respect for the caprices of another. But true love would
turn into contempt for the one who could wantonly subject it
to persistent insults and degradation; and contempt is the death
of genuine love, though yet compatible with sensual love.<a id="FNanchor_AH_34" href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">AH</a></p>

<p>True love is, therefore, characterized by patience, kindness,
generosity, humility, unselfishness, good temper, and sincerity.
This spectrum of true love shows the same elements as does that
of genuine friendship. True love, therefore, can only be acquired
in the same way as true friendship, namely, after a long
probationary interval. Then only will the true love supply the
universal need of friendship. Marriage is no barrier to the existence
of unselfish and sexless love, which is the essence of the
truest and purest friendship. If a husband be truly the friend
of his wife, his love for her as a friend would be just as strong,
just as tender, just as permanent and unswerving as if she were
not his wife, nor ever might be. Nay, it may be said with
Tolstoy that unless married people have been united by pure
love, without a mixture of animal passion, the time must come
when they will become weary of each other.</p>

<p>Duboc had only sensual love in mind when he said: To
be adored and admired is, in distinction from friendship, the
criterion of love, while the criterion of friendship, in distinction
from love, is to be understood and esteemed; the latter is
delighted in its illusions, the former harbors an element inimical
to all illusions. Sentimental love is also an enemy to illusions.
Sentimental love, as distinguished from friendship, is dependent
upon sexual differentiation. Pure oxygen would burn the lungs
after a very short time, pure nitrogen suffocates every animal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
but “both combined maintain life,” says Ellen Key. Mere sensual
attraction is not love, nor is friendship love; in combination
they are the air of life. When two souls have joys which the
senses share, and when the senses have delights which the
souls ennoble, then the result is neither desire nor friendship, it
is a new feeling. The only distinction between true love and pure
friendship is that the most ideal relation between man and man
in friendship is transferred to man and woman in love. Hence
these two relationships must possess the same qualities. Paternal,
filial and fraternal love partake each, in some degree, of
instinct and are, to that extent, impulsive and blind. But in
true love, instinct and sensuality have no place. “She is sacred
to me,” says Goethe’s Werther, “all desire is silent in her presence.”
A gleam of such wedded friendship transcends all other
kinds of love. Wherever there is a pure and unselfish love for
another for that other’s own sake, a love contingent neither on
its return nor on its recognition, there is true friendship.</p>

<p>Sentimental love, like its comrade friendship, furthers the
display of nobility and native virtues of the human soul. To
love one’s soul for its beauty, grace and truth, to be inspired
by the charm of its character to an affection which is pure and
chaste, is to open the way to appreciate all beautiful and true
and gracious souls. It offers the most refined of the pleasures
which make life worth living. Joy demands that its joy should
be shared.<a id="FNanchor_AI_35" href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">AI</a> We need sympathy; hence we crave friendship and
love. By the devotion of the other we feel our own power,
our own value enhanced. Love tends to make man kinder and
better through his complete identification with the existence of
another. In the beauty of a loving attachment, man learns to
comprehend all his fellowmen and to value and look at all the
world by the glorious light of an inner community of emotions.</p>

<p>Such love must be proved and purified by the fire of reasoning.
It is only possible after a thorough study of the character.
The subtle elective affinity, of which we hear so much
praised on the lecture platform, on the stage, in the magazines
and in the papers, cannot be relied upon; its thrill is uncertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
and needs to be tested and corrected by a long trial, whether
it is really spiritual kinship or only emotional impulse. If
after the veil of fantasy has been removed, the beloved object
is still found worthy of the highest and warmest esteem, the
emotion will be far nobler than, and different from, the unconscious
fondness which overlooks the exact estimation of the
beloved. In all love, considered as a virtue or grace, there
must always be the conscious will, which is also the foundation
of morality.</p>

<p>Such love may also reach the highest state of passion,
but in distinction from sensual love, it seeks its own happiness
<em>in</em> the felicity of the other, and conscious of its own disinterested
purity, considers its desires as noble and above general
motives of human action. Such emotions can only exist between
men and women of pure souls.</p>

<p>True love is, therefore, rational, conscious, unselfish, deep,
enduring, constant, refined, self-denying, and is willing to make
the greatest sacrifices for the sake of the happiness of another.
It is conscious altruism, never faltering in its ethical sense of
duty. It is love tested and purified in the fire of the intellect;
it comes slowly, but it endures; it gives more than it takes,
and has a tinge of tender gratitude for a thousand kind actions.
It is, therefore, an ideal sentiment which has hitherto been
reached only by a very few select.</p>

<p>But if we look at love in the light of evolution, when
we find how cell-division developed into sexuality, conjugation,
permanent mating, sensual love and, finally, into sentimental
love, there is reason for hope that the still rare fruits of an
apparently more than earthly paradise of love, which only the
forerunners of the race have been privileged to gather, will
some day, when humanity has reached the state of Nietzsche’s
Superman, become the universal food of the human race.</p>

<p><i>Development of love in the individual.</i>—The evolutionary
trend in this world can be detected not only in the mere preservation,
but also in increasing perfection. Not only the preservative
instinct, i. e., the will to live and the will to reproduce,
has contributed to the advancement of organic life to higher
forms, but the two perfective human instincts, i. e., the will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
to act and the will to rule, have also served as a means for
the evolution of human activities, as science, art, economics, etc.<a id="FNanchor_AJ_36" href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">AJ</a>
One of such activities is sentimental love which had to pass
through all the different stages of evolution before it reached
the complexity of its present structure. Evolution is a truly
universal principle. The meaning of life is its advance towards
higher forms. There is not a trait, physical, psychical or
spiritual that is wholly finished. The higher emotions as love
and hate, fear and shame, etc., are not born with the child;
they are evolved slowly by degrees.</p>

<p>According to Nordau every individual is in love with his
own ideal, throughout his entire life. Every man and woman
falls in love with the representative identical with, or at least
most resembling, his or her ideal. The craving for love is
the desire to possess the organic ideal.</p>

<p>The ideal of the mate begins to be distinctly evolved by
the organism at the time of puberty and is complete only late
in life. The ideal, except in its general features, is not stationary;
it grows with the individual’s physical and mental
development. With the beginning of the material growth of
the centre of generation, the imagination begins to receive from
the mysterious depths of the cells and tissues the conception
of the image of the mate. The organism hears indistinctive
voices, all telling the tale of the future partner in life. In
this way the image of the ideal grows up in the brain during
the individual’s amatory life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>Higher eroticism requires, then, the beloved to be a vehicle
of a projected personality. Love for a man or a woman is the
attempt to realize one’s ideal in the man or the woman. The
impulse to love is the search after the incarnation of the inward
ideal, and falling in love is the instinctive conviction
that the ideal has been found. The lower and simpler the
individual himself, the simpler will be the qualities of his ideal
in corporate form. Among people of a low state of civilization
the qualities required of the ideal are so few that almost every
individual of one sex represents the ideal of the other sex.
They may both be paired like animals, and love does not yet
exist. The more cultivated a person becomes, the more complicated
become the qualities demanded of his ideal, and the
harder it is for him to find the same. A person looking for
physical qualities in his ideal or for external beauty only, will
easily find them, and a case of love at first sight, about which
romantic dreamers go into such raptures, is naturally possible.
But such love is only sensual and does not deserve to be thus
extolled. For true love among men and women of a higher
state of culture is an ideal symphony of tones of all kinds.</p>

<p>Generally bodily perfection and a retiring, tender, beneficent,
confiding nature in woman constitute an attractive ideal
for the man, while mental superiority in man constitutes the
attractive power for the cultured woman. In her love the regard
for masculine beauty usually forms an unimportant ingredient.
The woman, says Kant, has an exquisite feeling for
the beautiful, so far as she herself is concerned, but for the
noble so far as it is found in the man. The man, on the contrary,
has a decided feeling for the noble, which belongs to his
own qualities, but for the beautiful so far as it is met with in
the woman. Hence it follows that the aims of nature are
directed through love upon making men still nobler and women
more beautiful.</p>

<p>The masculine virtues which impress true women are physical
strength, courage, nobility of mind, chivalry and self-confidence.
These virtues constitute the beauty which arouses the
woman’s love, these are the conspicuous features of her ideal.
The female virtues that impress the man are beauty, tenderness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
goodness, refinement, truth and patience. These are the virtues
his ideal possesses. The more highly cultivated mentally and
physically he or she are, the more complex and differentiated
are the qualities of their ideals. Hence refined and complex
natures experience a great deal of difficulty in meeting with
their ideals or any one closely approximating them. But when
two happen to perfectly compliment each other, when each happens
to represent the ideal of the other, then there is true and
lasting love. Such people know their ideal when they meet it
and have been given time to study it, and they also know that
they will never find another one in this world; they know that
only this being and no other is suited to them as one triangle
is to its congruent.</p>

<p>This knowledge can only be gained after a long study
of the qualities of the person found, as to whether they really
coincide with the mental qualities of the ideal; and it takes
such noble beings longer to fall in love. Coarser natures are
readily able to fall in love. The sensual qualities which attract
a man or a woman to a paramour are easily discovered.
When the affections mount no higher than mere feeling, a true
communion of hearts is not indispensable. When the union of
the man and the woman is regarded only from the physical
basis, when the object is only self-gratification, the finer phases
may be and really are ignored. Mere sensual enjoyment can
be experienced by two persons who otherwise despise each other.<a id="FNanchor_AK_37" href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">AK</a>
But true love has far nobler aspirations than sensual enjoyment,
and promises a union of heart and soul.</p>

<p>Among intellectual persons mere instinct becomes more
and more powerless until it is almost totally extinguished.
True love among them is, then, a voluntary act. The plans
for its accomplishment are elaborated in the mind slowly and
intelligently. It has then all the qualities of true friendship,
combined with an affection in which sensual desire is working
to a greater or less extent only unconsciously. As fusing body
and mind it may become one of the strongest, deepest and most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
influential of the passions of our nature. It opens up horizons
above and beyond the earth so vast that this mundane sphere
dwindles into insignificance.</p>

<p><i>Woman’s love.</i>—In emotional natures love exerts a predominant
and frequently even supreme influence upon the
whole consciousness of the individual. It produces effects upon
his judgment, his fantasy and his will. It excites conceptions
borrowed from the domain of sex and gives to all the work
of the brain an erotic tendency and a sexual polarity.</p>

<p>Now, the woman lives more by her emotions than the man.
The part she plays in the propagation of the kind is also by
far the more important one. She has to supply the whole
material for the formation of the new being; the man only
supplies the stimulation to this heroic work. The woman’s
centre of sexual activity is, therefore, more developed. The
activity of the generative centres occupies an important position
in the activity of her brain as a whole. Sexual life concerns
her more nearly, more deeply and more lastingly than the man.
She is able to do nothing else but love. Sexual matters imperiously
mingle with all her motives and influence all her
aims. To her love is life. Marriage is her highest ideal, and
domestic happiness is and ever will be her ultimate aim.<a id="FNanchor_AL_38" href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">AL</a></p>

<p>Women, even maidens, says Hume, take more offence at
satires upon matrimony than taunts upon their sex. Woman
knows the attraction her sex has upon the other, and smiles
at the insincerity of sex-criticism. But matrimony is holy to
her. She has a natural tendency to regard wedded love as the
single aim and substance of the life of human beings. Sexual
consciousness is stronger in her than in man, and her need of
true love is greater. She lives largely in her affections, and her
constant desire is to attract and please.</p>

<p>In her natural state the woman, therefore, possesses a more
distinctly developed ideal. On dissecting and analyzing the
female heart at any age, and however married, we should prob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>ably
find that the original ideal is still lingering there. Woman
is constantly groping and making experiments, whereby she
attempts to realize the ideal of her dreams in the actual men
of her acquaintance. The instinct of selection is very important
to her. By it she recognizes her affinity, the man best fitted
by nature to father her children. She unconsciously feels the
need of a partner who will organically compliment her. She
possesses an instinctive sensation of what is organically necessary
to her for the continuation and intensification of her
qualities in the offspring.</p>

<p>For the woman the step of choosing a partner is the most
important act of her life. She has an instinctive sensation that
she ought not to make a mistake, and is extremely careful to
avoid the least likelihood of error. She instinctively feels that
her mistakes cannot be corrected. She is monoandric in character.
She is aware that purely sensual love cannot last. Hence
she looks more for mental merits, and has a high appreciation
of a fine character. She is looking for qualities that will outlive
the freshness of physical charms. Her innate solicitude is to
continue the love-charm all through married life. Hence she
is governed by ideas of the sublime and the beautiful. Only
a man endowed with such qualities can inspire in her true love
and its unsurpassed pleasure and joy in life. When so inspired,
she surrounds the object of her love with the halo of perfection.</p>

<p>The man, says Dessoir, is able to accomplish and find pleasure
in sex activity without his soul partaking in it, but the
woman does not find gratification in this activity if the soul
has not been first excited by the beauty, strength and personality
of her partner.</p>

<p>Love to a woman is an exalted and noble thing; she stakes
her life upon it. She has, therefore, to be more fastidious in
her choice of a consort than the man. This partly explains the
mystery of modesty and coyness. She remains passive while
she is wooed for her favor. Love, says Walker, is the empire
of woman. The consciousness of weakness in woman leads her
instinctively to her dissimulation, her finesse, her little contrivances,
her manners, her graces and her coquetry. By these
means she simultaneously endeavors to create love, and not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
show what she feels, while by means of modesty she feigns to
refuse what she desires to grant.</p>

<p>By an imperious power and charming tyranny she tries to
prevent the man she loves from stirring from her side. She is
ever desirous to fascinate and bewitch him. She feels herself
to be a powerful centre of love and attraction around which
everything ought to revolve. The woman, says Kant, has from
early girlhood the confidence in her ability to please; the youth,
the fear to displease. He is, therefore, shy in the presence of
women. His desire is to be governed—before marriage—hence
the chivalry of youth, while the woman’s desire is to rule. She
wants man to surround her with an insatiable desire. She
wishes to be loved and yearns to evoke man’s admiration for
her by all her womanly qualities. She gives herself up entirely
and irrevocably and never forgives the chosen possessor for
examining too little the value of his treasure.</p>

<p><i>Obstructions of love’s development.</i>—Healthy and natural
love is always clearly conscious of its purpose, the ideal is always
in existence, waiting for the opportunity to meet the
materialized duplicate. Men and women have an unconscious
sensation of the qualities of their ideals of the other sex, that
by their union their respective qualities may be transmitted in
an intensified degree to their offspring. Hence if the instinct
has not become dulled by monetary considerations, if social
reasons, religious prejudices or customs do not rise to confuse
and pervert the instinct, men and women will, should there be
many from whom to choose, select with unerring certainty the
one who most closely approximates the psychic ideal which they
have elaborated within themselves at the moment of sexual
maturity.</p>

<p>But true love is only possible if the natural development
has not been disturbed nor the natural course interrupted, and
the young people have been given the opportunity to develop
their ideals. If the development is arrested, if the growth of
the erotic instinct is disturbed, at the time of restlessness and
nerve-irritability, then the image of the ideal in the mind is
confused and the discovery of its organic counterpart is impossible.
Now, the whole nervous system is under great tension<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
during the formation period. Inquietude, vague unrest and
dissatisfaction disturbs the boy’s equanimity. His heart is
tremulous with emotion and represents a volcano of agitation
in perpetual eruption. He exudes intense feeling and passion.
The mind of the girl is confused with vague dissatisfaction and
vaguer desires which she vainly endeavors to define even to
herself. Her heart is wildly stirred and issues from its chrysalis
to renewed dreams of chimerical bliss. Joy and sorrow, exultation
and depression alternate like dawn and dusk. All the complex
subtleties of the feminine heart give rein to a single emotion.
She lives in the realm of romance, her soul keeps soaring
in the land of glamor. Hence the least disturbance will be fatal
to the development of a clear and distinct image of the ideal.</p>

<p>Such disturbances are ever present in our advanced civilization.
The early intimate association with the other sex, among
the poorer classes, gives palpable suggestions of the libido connected
with the functions of reproduction, at a time when mystery
ought to shroud its object. Animal passion, especially in
great cities, obtrudes itself upon the attention of young children,
and they become conscious of the greatest of all human
needs through the desire of the flesh, and not by a gradual
growing sympathy for a noble being, possessing lasting gifts of
sentiment and thought. The sentiments are, therefore, not of
true love but of lust; and to transform lust into love is a difficult
task.</p>

<p>Besides the unfavorable environment, certain radical doctrines,
widely spread among the laboring classes, also prevent
true love from taking root. In the literature, often read by
these classes, excuses are readily made for the supremacy of the
passions. Dithyrambs are sung upon the crudest emotions. The
rational ethics of these radical moralists teach that “love worketh
no evil.” True love may really do no evil, but gross passion,
which these teachers of the new sex-morality call love, is capable
to do all the harm in the world. Temporary sexual attraction,
which is sensuality pure and simple, is called by the name of
love and is made the basis of the new morality. The name of
the sublimest emotion which appeals to the grandest impulses,
to the noblest sentiments of men and women, which makes chiv<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>alrous,
gentle, refined and helpful all who are touched by its
magic wand, which informs its disciples with the spirit of honor
(Walker), the name of this noble emotion is conferred upon the
coarse emotion of sensuality, as if sensuality ever possessed all
these ennobling qualities. The greater part of humanity is declared
to be polygamous in nature. According to these radical
doctrines only few men and women possess the instinct of exclusiveness,
all other are naturally varietists. Consequently
promiscuity is the ordained order of nature, and the monogamic
marriage is decried as forced upon humanity by priest and
tyrant.<a id="FNanchor_AM_39" href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">AM</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>Among the cultured and exclusive classes there is another
danger lurking to the development of true sentimental love.
It is the literary fiction of our time which is thoroughly imbued
with the most unwholesome forms of love. The first knowledge
of the world and of life is usually derived by the children of
these classes from novels, and these novels deal from the first
line to the last with nothing but love. The heroes and heroines
in these novels are usually the creations of pathological brains,
in different stages of degeneration, and are represented as worthy
of emulation. These heroes change with every novel, and the
children admire every day another ideal, imposed upon them
from without, before their imaginations had the time for the
conception of an ideal from the mysterious depths of the cells
of the growing centre of generation. Besides, the authors of
these novels are, as a rule, dealing with a perverted kind of love,
which they call holy, beneficent, infallible, and which they consider
above all laws. Their teachings are to obey the impulse
of love with a fanaticism that disregards all bounds and barriers,
codes and warnings of the sages. All obstacles, such as duty,
modesty, honor, respect for the family and the rights of fellow
men, that weave around everyone of us a firm and massy weft,
all of them are treated like cobwebs that love tears away and
treads upon to gain its end.</p>

<p>The eroding operations carried on by these mongrel degenerated
brains cannot help but have a poisonous effect, especially
upon the minds of young girls. While in the literature
of half a century ago the heroine represented the fundamental
type of woman, who is a mother of men, calling out men’s sacrifice
and sacrificing herself for them, without calculation or barter,
the heroine of the contemporary novel gives herself up to
voluptuous excesses. The absence of chastity is considered a sign
of the warmth of her feeling, moral decrepitude is called by
the doubtful name “self-assertion,” and the exaggerated taste for
self-indulgence is termed “self-expression.” Feminine selfishness
is represented as an enviable instead of a base quality.
Under such circumstances true love must, indeed, be a rare
occurrence.</p>

<p>More fatal even to true love are the activities of the im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>moral
plays, because they are so deceptive and disingenuous and
sail under the guise of moral reforms. There are first the comic
plays, nowadays filling most of the stages, which treat immorality
as a subject for jocularity, and where an unchaste situation is
made the subject of a jest. Then there are some serious plays
where sin and the life of immorality are idealized. The career
of the courtesan is pictured as a life of gentleness, refinement
and renunciation. (La Dame aux Camélias.) In recent times
a third kind of immoral plays has made its appearance upon
the stage where immoral situations are portrayed, without regard
to time-honored conventionalities, with such exactness that
the warnings against the evils fail to fulfill their purpose.</p>

<p>Another blow fatal to true love, caused by the reading of
contemporary literature, is the increase of the young girl’s
natural vanity.<a id="FNanchor_AN_40" href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">AN</a> The constant descriptions in most modern
novels of the struggle over women and the enthusiasm felt at
gaining her, says Nordau, increase her natural tendency to regard
love as the single aim and substance of the life of human
beings and intensify her natural partiality for herself to the
degree of ambitious mania and self-deification. She actually
imagines that the possession of her would be providential of
more than earthly bliss. The pampered overcivilized modern
woman finds in this pseudo-literature only lovers who are sacrificing
to the divinity of beauty and who are constantly listening
to the music of the stars, and she imagines that she also ought
to be wooed by gods and spend her life in an earthly paradise.
When after the wedding the mirage, she once thought was the
eternal land of promise, has faded, she remains permanently
shocked at finding only a man where she was looking for an
angel as mate. When the longing for sensual satisfaction has
been appeased, both lovers find that they have no more to discover
and grow fickle and hunger for a change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>Another part of contemporary literature which is continually
undermining the foundation of true love is the feministic
branch. These writers are not satisfied to preach equality of
the sexes. They constantly emphasize the superiority of the
female sex. From this notion to the sermon of sex-antagonism
is only one step, and this has been quickly enough made. Mutual
admiration, trust and love have given place to the duel of the
sexes. Even the father has been thrown overboard. These
modern daughters act as if they had come to this world by the
way of parthenogenesis. The sermon of the enmity of the sexes
thus destroys not only true love, but the entire conception of the
family and serves to blight the brightest and sweetest flowers,
springing in the garden of the human heart. No wonder that
the girl who has been influenced by such ideas has been made
unfit for true love. Her judgment has become confused by overestimating
her own worth and valuing the man solely for his
capacity to supply the luxuries of life and to satisfy sensual
desires. She has little love even for the man of her choice, and
is not reluctant to show it on every occasion. A bride objecting
to the word “obey” in the wedding ceremony—even granted that
such a word does not and never did belong there—reveals at
once her lack of true love. A girl truly in love with the man
laughs at the word, because she feels that she would rather be
his slave than any other man’s queen. To the lover the bride’s
promise to obey seems mere folly, for he is determined that she
should always remain the autocratic queen of his heart and
actions. But when love is absent, and the wedding represents
nothing more than a contract to legalize sensuality, which is
otherwise considered immoral, every objection to the wording
of the contract is justified and perfectly natural.</p>

<p>The female sex, says Kant, may be characterized by two
inclinations, the desire to dominate, and the desire for pleasure.
These two tendencies may be mitigated by true love. The truly
loving woman will gladly and voluntarily share material misfortune
and social degradation with her lover. She will overcome
her egotism, she will labor hard to overcome her old faults
and cheerfully give up what she once looked upon as necessaries
for the love of a true man. But the modern woman looks upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
the man only as a slave to provide for her, and as a thing affording
her enjoyment. Hence she regards the miserable weakling,
whose imbecile brain has not the power of resistance, as touching
and charming, while vigorous strength of character, which is
schooled in self-control and which places as high a value on the
affection afforded as on that received, seems to her repulsive
roughness. This blending of her judgment becomes fatal to her
love, so important to the female heart.</p>

<p>Love, in its ideal form, must be founded on mental qualities.
In man the mental qualities are of the greatest value. The
supreme survival value for man is his intelligence. The possessors
of artistic or literary composition, of mechanical skill, of
calculating ability, of energy or general mental ability are seldom
or never endowed at the same time with physical qualities. It
was brain not brawn that saved man in his struggle for existence.
The cult of the muscle as against intelligence would destroy
man. The physically fittest is not always the best of men.
Even the animals, in their natural surroundings, live by their
wits rather than by force of bone and muscle; and it was man’s
wits and will that enabled him to increase and multiply as no
other animal. Physical weapons of defense and offense have
disappeared in man because his intelligence makes them superfluous.
In the human species mind is master of matter. Man
has staked his all upon mind. The emergence and dominance
of mind have enabled the human species to ascend through
struggle and internecine war to the highest scale of animal life,
although it is physically one of the feeblest among the species of
the higher animals. The increasing dominance of mind over
matter is the reason that nowadays mental qualities dominate
all else in man’s living activities. Hence ideal love must also
be based upon mental qualities. Then it will be everlasting.
The soul once allied with its mate can change no more. One
of the mysteries of true love is the absolute impossibility to
duplicate the lover. The soul is thus the essential part in true
love. But when in the selection of the mates the physical factors
only, such as stature, beauty, strength and health, play the
most important rôle, when the senses form the chief part of
the compound feeling, love will not long survive possession,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
and matrimonial happiness, founded upon monetary or social
considerations, will pass like a shadow. The idol is soon destroyed.
When, thereupon, the heart is disillusioned by the contact
with the grim realities of existence, when it is deadened by
the habitude of a fixed affection, coupled with incompatibility of
tastes, when hardened by experience with the meanness of the
world, then men and women attempt to find elsewhere a soul
which they hope will desire to know more of their own, and in
which they trust to discover a greater and more lasting happiness.
But not being able to ask their own hearts, and guided only
by the contradictory ideals they have been imbued with in their
youth, the second choice and all the others, following the same,
will generally turn out to be also delusions in which the perfect
communion of hearts will again be absent. Men will then try
to bury their unsatisfied longing for true affection in the exaggerated
occupation with business or to drown their vehement
unrequited love-yearnings in drink and other narcotics. The
fate of the woman is even more tragic. Woman’s idea of happiness
is a sort of ecstatic bliss. She is looking for perennial joy
and beauty, for a joy as only the angels know. Hence when she
learns to know the illusory nature of the heart’s greatest desire,
when she makes the discovery of the futility of this desire, the
wine of life grows sour. She becomes self-centered and selfish.
The fountain ordained to yield such perennial sweets is soon
drained and she bestows all her feminine faculties upon mere
inanities. Hence the astonishing aspect of restlessness, and
agitation which we now behold in her mania for dress, her indulgence
in drink and nerve-deadening drugs, and in her quest
of other vain luxuries in which she desires to drown the emptiness
of her heart and her spiritual isolation.</p>

<small>EROS, LIBIDO, JEALOUSY</small></h3>


<p><i>Eros and libido.</i>—Eros and libido are the two components
of sensual love and are also integral parts of sentimental love,
by which the latter differs from pure friendship. Libido represents
the material pleasure enjoyed by the contact; eros represents
the spiritual enjoyment experienced by the knowledge of
loving and being loved. Hence libido is of a somatic nature,
eros is a psychic phenomenon. The libidinous individual has an
increased desire for sexual gratification, the erotic looks chiefly
for love. The erotic individual loves with its mind, it is a
craving for love by a particular individual, or by a certain class
of individuals, e. g., actors or actresses. The libidinous individual
is satisfied with any partner and even with other practices,
serving sensual gratification, such as contrectatio, stuprum
manu, paederastia, tribady, bestiality, etc. The erotic individual
never thinks of the sensual pleasure, the libidinous
desires to wallow in sensual enjoyment and lust.</p>

<p>Libido is more a masculine sex trait, eros more a feminine.
For the ordinary man the libidinous part of love is of primary
importance. When this emotion has been destroyed by some
accident, he considers himself emasculated. He will never reveal
the loss of his testicles, while a woman will openly and freely
talk of ovariotomy, performed upon her, although the loss of
the ovaries generally produces the impotence of experiencing
orgasm, as in men the loss of the testicles. She seems not to
mind this loss, provided, always, that her eros has remained
intact.</p>

<p>In this indifference for sexual libido, so often found in
women, lies the cause of woman’s superiority in sensual love.
The woman rules over the man as long as he is in love. That
man is henpecked who from the beginning, by reason of his excessive
sexual needs, came under his wife’s authority and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
continually kept under her rule by the same sensual needs. A
man’s dependence upon his wife can only be explained upon a
sensual basis. As soon as the man’s power and intelligence
gain the victory over his sensual impulses, his independence
is secured.</p>

<p>This is the reason why the woman is continually bent upon
keeping the man’s libido alive. Her constant desire is to influence
him by her charms. Her passivity, says Marro, is the
passivity of the magnet, which in spite of its apparent immobility
and rest attracts the iron, be the latter willing or not, and in
a way enslaves it. An intense energy lies behind such passivity,
says Ellis, an absorbed preoccupation in the end to be attained.
But for her passivity and cunning coyness she would become the
real slave of brutal force, and nothing short of adoration of her
lord and master would satisfy him. As it is, she keeps the
man in due bounds, even in countries where her legal status is
not much higher than that of the real slave. The pride of the
woman, says Kant, to keep at a distance all the importunities
of men by the respect she inspires and the right to demand
respect for her person, even without merits, belong to her by
the title of her sex. The man has to woo for her favor even
where he could command. The indulgence with an unwilling or
unreciprocating mate is not satisfactory to the normal man.
This is the reason why the mere satisfaction of the physical
appetite in meretricious venery is so unsatisfactory to him.</p>

<p>Eros is a purely psychic phenomenon. It is the transcendental
attraction of the two sexes, even when lust is not thought
of. In being attracted to one another, the sexes seem to obey a
higher will, unknown to either of them. The attraction probably
emanates from the spermatozoa and ova. The little cells know
what they want and take it. But their will is unknown to the
lovers themselves. Their attraction appears to be as mysterious as
the attraction of the two poles of the magnet, which no scientist
has yet been able to elucidate. This mysterious erotic attraction
is healthy and invigorating. While so attracted, the sexual
glands increase the secretion of the testines or ovarines, and
these chemical products have a tonic effect and make the individual
happy. This accounts for the happy excitement the sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
of a perfect specimen of the opposite sex, or even its conception
in the fantasy, is able to awake in the heart of the individual.</p>

<p><i>Two desires of eros.</i>—Eros consists of two desires, to love
and to be loved. The man is more anxious to love, the woman
to be loved. She desires to feel that she is admired or
rather coveted by men. That woman withers who, in all her
life, was never once loved by some man. Even the woman who
for moral or morbid reasons renounces libido, will still have
the desire to be admired and loved. In her day-dreams the girl
pictures to herself an ideal man by whom she wishes to be loved,
the man portrays in his imagination the girl he wishes to love.
When he meets with his ideal he knows his own mind about
his love. He recognizes the goddess upon whose altar he
intends to burn his choicest incense. The girl has first to ask
her oracle. She plucks the petals of her marguerite, lisping:
“He loves me, he loves me not.” The man, more concerned
about his own love, wears his heart on his sleeve and feels eager
to have the beloved see how passionately it throbs for her. The
woman, having first to discover the man’s love, will try to conceal
her own emotion in the innermost recesses of her bosom,
lest the lover discover her feelings prematurely. The woman is,
therefore, a comma, in love affairs, the man a full stop; here,
you know where you are; there, read further.</p>

<p>The woman is anxious to be loved by the man of her choice,
the man mainly asks for the privilege to love her. This difference
is mainly based upon the different value love possesses in the
eyes of the two sexes. With the man the imagination does not
need to come into play before he can look for joys and sorrows,
hopes and fears that make up the sum and substance of love.
The woman gives far more than her body, she gives her soul,
her very self, her all. Another reason for the woman’s desire
to be loved lies in her feminine vanity. In the relations of
friends the one who desires to be loved rather than to love, is
the more egotistic. The preference of the passive part of love
to the active unquestionably springs from the root of egotism
in human nature. In the relation of the sexes, the desire to be
loved arises more or less from the wish to satisfy personal vanity.
It is tacitly, although, as a rule, among civilized men erroneously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
assumed that personal excellence is the cause of a particular
individual of one sex being loved by the other, and that one
sex is the better judge of the excellence of the other. Hence the
person most deeply loved must of necessity excel his rivals. He
must at least possess greater sexual charms which men and
women are chiefly proud of. Vain men, for that reason, will
boast of the large number of their love affairs and the many
hearts broken. For the same reason a woman’s vanity is flattered
to be openly preferred and loved by a good, respectable
man. In present society only matrimony can satisfy her vanity.
For free love can only be clandestine, and clandestine love satisfies
only her libido, but not her vanity.</p>

<p><i>Jealousy.</i>—The desire for the satisfaction of personal vanity
and the commonly erroneous assumption of the better judgment
of one sex about the excellence of the other, are of the greatest
importance in the psychology of jealousy.</p>

<p>Sexual jealousy<a id="FNanchor_AO_41" href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">AO</a> consists of three different emotions: 1)
anguish at the suspicion or knowledge of violated chastity or
outraged affection; 2) rage at a rival, and 3) revenge for the
violation of a vested right. Anguish is the primary emotion,
rage and revenge are its results. There are always three actors
in every case of jealousy, the outraged victim, the mate and the
rival. Of the three emotions anguish relates to the male, rage
to the rival, and revenge concerns both the rival and the mate.
In the analysis of the different emotions in the train of jealousy
it is found that anguish, anxiety, fear and despair, which accompany
jealousy and apparently constitute its essence, are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
caused by outraged affection only, for the highest degree of
jealousy is often found where love has long ceased to exist, and
even when hatred has already entered into the relation of the
mates. Anguish over violated chastity does not explain jealousy
either, for jealousy is found among savages, who unhesitatingly
lend their wives to others, or offer them as a courtesy to other
men without any thought of their wives’ chastity. Neither does
interference with one’s enjoyment explain jealousy. For the
husband is always jealous of his wife’s lover, while the lover is
rarely jealous of the husband. Yet the husband’s opportunity
of interfering with the lover’s possession is by far greater than
that of the latter with the husband’s. Thus fear of interference
cannot play any great part in the emotion of jealousy. The
revenge for the violation of vested rights cannot alone explain
the terrible emotion of jealousy, which the royal poet of the
“Song of Songs” declares to be “as cruel as the grave.” Besides,
jealousy is often found where there are no vested rights at all,
only a pretended claim.</p>

<p>The cause of jealousy must, therefore, be sought elsewhere.
There must be a reason for the husband’s jealousy of a lover
and the absence of this emotion in the mind of the lover towards
the husband and the presence of jealousy in the heart of the lover
in relation to any other succeeding lover. There must be a
reason why the lover usually feels a kind of exultation at deceiving
the husband or any other lover who has a previous claim
upon the woman’s affection.</p>

<p>The cause of jealousy is mainly personal vanity. Just as
the satisfaction to be loved, where one does not love himself, lies
in satisfied vanity, so is jealousy based unconsciously upon the
anguish of wounded vanity. This explains the psychological
difference between husband and lover, or between first and second
lover. The woman who loves one man is supposed to confer a
certain honor upon him, but her indulgence with two men honors
the one who has the lesser right upon her love. He who has
the greater or the first claim is made an object of ridicule. Man
in a natural state, not influenced by motives of civilization—and
there it may really be true—considers the abandoned or
deceived person the less charming and the less worthy. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
original notion has been transmitted to us from our remote
ancestors and unconsciously governs us even at the present day.
The man who is loved by a married woman or the woman who
is loved by a married man are supposed to possess certain excellencies
which are lacking in their respective married partners.
The latter are, therefore, exposed to ridicule.</p>

<p>Jealousy, therefore, is simply wounded vanity. The individual
possessing a greater deal of vanity will also be jealous
to a greater degree. Hence, as a rule, woman is more jealous
than man, although the latter may be more brutal when in that
mood.</p>

<p>Vanity and exposure to ridicule explain also why the wife,
betrayed by her husband, when she confronts the culprits, generally
attacks her rival. Vanity does not allow her to admit
even to herself that her husband has preferred the other to her.
Consequently her rival must have used some seductive means
to entice her poor, worthy husband and to lead him astray. The
rival is hence the one who deserves punishment. The husband,
on the other hand, if betrayed by his wife, will attack first his
wife, who has exposed him to ridicule; her lover generally concerns
him in a lesser degree.</p>

<p>If personal vanity is not wounded, jealousy is also absent.
A great man, acknowledged by the world as such, like Alexander
or Caesar, is not jealous if his wife betrays him with an ordinary
mortal. In this case the world sees the stupidity of the woman.
She is not able to recognize the value of her husband and exposes
herself to ridicule. A great man may, therefore, grieve
over the loss of cherished affections, but he will rarely be jealous.
A comely and cultured woman will never be jealous of her
coarse and ignorant maid-servant. She has only pity for her
husband’s aberration of taste.</p>

<p>A woman will seldom or never be jealous of the women
her husband has consorted with before their marriage. She is
not exposed to ridicule through his former love affairs. He did
not marry the others but her. She was preferred. But for the
possible impairment of his health and vigor, the more love
affairs he had the more the wife is honored. The man has not
been changed by his former love affairs. His wife has hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
no palpable reason for resentment, and she may pardon her
husband’s former love affairs without any derogation to her
dignity. Not so man.</p>

<p>The woman’s anatomy is changed by defloration. The
sperma is partly absorbed within her,<a id="FNanchor_AP_42" href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">AP</a> and through her veins
circulate material parts of her lover. She may have been pregnant
for some time, and pregnancy changes the woman’s entire
anatomy. She has partly nourished her system with blood owing
half its nature to her child’s father. The woman has, therefore,
a perennial impression left by her former mate.<a id="FNanchor_AQ_43" href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">AQ</a> This
is the reason why aesthetic and fastidious men refrain from
marrying a widow or a divorced woman. This is also the reason
why the husband consciously or unconsciously resents his wife’s
former escapades. This resentment is not jealousy, although it
is commonly so called. Sorrow over his wife’s former violated
chastity, which conventionality considers as the biggest crime a
woman could commit, is not jealousy. He is only grieved that
her former impurity has lowered her value. A woman really
gives herself up, soul and body, to her first lover. The virginity
of her heart is no longer intact. The fragrance has departed
from the rose. The earnest man who actually gives up
his soul to the wife of his choice and to the mother of his children
expects in return a pure and virgin heart.</p>

PATHOLOGY OF SEXUALITY</h2>

<small>PARADOXIA</small></h3>


<p>The pathology of love treats only of sensual love or of sensuality.
The anomalies of sentimental love lie more properly
within the province of the metaphysician or sociologist. Hence
only the pathologic aspect of sensuality will be considered in
the following part.</p>

<p>The analysis of sexuality has revealed the great complexity
of the sexual instinct. No wonder, therefore, that the intricacies
of love show many and varied anomalies. The anomalies
based upon anatomical defects may easily be omitted. The
number of works written on this subject is legion. They could
fill whole libraries. But the psychical anomalies of love have
enjoyed until very recently scanty attention at the hands of
medical writers. Especially has modern gynaecology hitherto
entirely neglected the psychical part of its specialty and has
directed its attention only upon diseases that require surgical
interference or other local manipulation.</p>

<p>The anomalies of the sexual impulse which will be analyzed
in the following chapters are those based upon some defects in
either of the three regions of the sexual sphere, the spinal cord,
where the centres of erection and ejaculation are situated; the
cerebellum, the seats of the impulses of voluptas and of libido
and of the sensations of touch, sight, smell, and hearing, which
usually provoke the impulses; and the cerebrum, with the higher
sensations, as the sentiment of beauty, of affection, of admiration,
of worship and of respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>The anomalies based upon defects in these nervous centres
properly belong within the province of the neurologist and
alienist. Yet in a treatise on sex-attraction such anomalies
should not be passed in silence. All the peculiarities of the
woman’s body and mind, her nutrition and nerve activity are
only a dependency of the ovary. The same may be justly said
of the man. Almost all of the activities of the normal man
stand in some relation to the testicular functions. The knowledge
of the abnormal psychical elements of the sexual instinct is,
therefore, of such importance to the general health and well-being
of the public and to the whole social structure, that every
physician and student of law or pedagogy ought to acquire a
general knowledge of the anomalies of sexual affections. The
man and woman who do not experience connubial satisfaction
will often seek a substitute for their unrequited love. The
whole foundation of society, the family, will begin to sag, if
in our nervous age the anomalies of sexuality are prudishly
overlooked and their study neglected.</p>

<p>The pathology of the sexual affections is, therefore, not
only a proper study for every student of medicine but for every
student of education, law and sociology as well. Krafft-Ebing’s
general classification of the anomalies of the sexual instinct will
also be followed here with more or less minor modifications.
Krafft-Ebing divides the pathology of sexuality into four parts.</p>


<p class="subh">I. PARADOXIA.</p>

<p>It means sexual activity in individuals who should normally
present no sexual manifestations, as the occurrence of
sexual excitation before the physiological age.</p>


<p class="subh">II. ANAESTHESIA.</p>

<p>It signifies partial or total absence of sexual feeling, i. e.,
impotence of voluptas. It also comprises all other kinds of
impotency, as impotence of libido or of copulation.</p>


<p class="subh">III. HYPERAESTHESIA.</p>

<p>It signifies the abnormal intensity of the sexual desire and
impulse, 1) Mixoscopy, 2) Erotomania, 3) Satyriasis, 4) Nymphomania,
5) Masturbation, 6) Incest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>


<p class="subh">IV. PARAESTHESIA.</p>

<p>It covers all possible forms of perversion of sexual feeling
and sexual activity. A) Heterosexuality: Inclination to persons
of the opposite sex, but with perverse activity. 1) Masochism,
2) Sadism, 3) Fetichism, 4) Exhibitionism. B) Homosexuality:
The sexual feeling is directed toward the same sex. a) Perversity,
1) out of lust, 2) as a profession, 3) through necessity,
4) out of fear, b) Perversion, 1) psychical hermaphrodism, 2)
strict homosexuality, 3) effemination or viraginity, 4) transvestism.
C) Bestiality: The sexual feelings are directed in conjugium
cum animalibus.</p>

<p><i>Paradoxia.</i>—Paradoxia signifies the sexual activity in individuals
who should normally present no sexual manifestations.
The occurrence of sexual excitement at an age when the individual
should ordinarily be without it belongs to this part of
the pathology of sexuality.</p>

<p>The continuance of the same degree of sexual desire in
very old men or in women after the climacterium, as it existed
before, is certainly unusual; yet it cannot be called pathological.
The occurrence of pregnancies in wives of very old men and in
women after the climacteric period proves that the ovaries continue
to secrete ova even after menstruation has ceased, and that
the testicles do not cease producing spermatozoa even beyond the
limit of three scores and ten. Now, the sexual desire depends
more upon the activity of the sexual glands than upon the
physiological changes in the nervous apparatus of the generative
organs in men or upon any changes in the uterus, which is only a
repository for the development of the foetus. Hence the absence
of erection in men or of menstruation in women does not
necessarily imply absence of sexual desire.</p>

<p>The appearance of sexual desire in boys before puberty
and in girls long before menstruation has set in is also, as yet,
within the limits of the normal; it becomes pathological only
when the sexual desire is manifested in infants or very small
children. Complete sexual development has been witnessed in
children as early as the second year. The precocity of develop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>ment
in the organs of generation is usually accompanied by
corresponding precocity in sexual desire.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The writer saw a baby who had a sanguineous discharge from her
genitals, for the first time, when she was only five days old. This discharge
appeared afterwards regularly every four weeks. At the autopsy
of another child one year old, one ovary was so enlarged that it awakened
the writer’s curiosity. At the microscopical examination he found
a ripe Graafian follicle. The writer also observed erections in a boy
eight days old, immediately after the ritual circumcision. In the beginning
he attributed these erections to the irritation of the wound.
But the erections continued even after the wound was completely healed.
The penis had the size of that of a boy four to five years of age.</p></blockquote>

<p>But even where the development of the genital organs conforms
with the age of the child, many cases are recorded of
children of great precocity. At this period of early childhood
there can be naturally no other sex activity except the habit
of autoeroticism. The natural curiosity of children leads them
to an examination and finally to a titillation of their private
organs, often without the aid of any vicious instruction. When
the child has thus found that a certain mode of handling these
organs is attended with pleasurable sensations, he repeats the
action, and the habit is established.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hirschsprung (Berl. Klin. Wochenschr. 1866, No. 38) observed three
cases of sexual activity in boys in the earliest childhood. The youngest
child was only sixteen months old. Membro mentulato, the boy
continued for over an hour to make rocking or wriggling movements,
until it would fall back exhausted and bathed in perspiration. Deep
sleep terminated the attacks which were repeated daily.</p>

<p>Rohleder (Die Masturbation, 3d Edit., p. 58) describes a case of a
boy, fifteen months old, qui faciebat motiones voluptarias fricando
virilia sua contra mammam matris. The attacks were marked by
staring eyes, burning face and oppressed breathing. At the acme of
the attack the child would break out in loud sobbing. The paroxysm
would last about ten minutes. Thereupon the child would fall asleep.</p></blockquote>

<p>The early aberration of the sexual instinct in childhood
is more frequently met with in girls than in boys. Probably
because the means for sensual gratificaton at the disposal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the infant girl are more numerous than that of the boy. The
mere thigh-crossing of the infant girl will serve the purpose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Townsend reports five cases of stuprum manu in girls under one
year of age. One, an infant, eight months old, would cross her right
thigh over the left, close her eyes, clench her fists, and after a minute or
two there would be complete relaxation, with perspiration and redness of
face. This would occur once a week or oftener.</p>

<p>In Lombroso’s case a girl of three years of age faciebat stuprum
manu aperte et pæne jugiter until marriage, and even afterwards.
She bore twelve children, neque desistebat a stupro manu even during
pregnancy. Of her twelve children, five died in infancy, four were
hydrocephalous, and the three surviving children were confirmed masturbators,
the oldest having begun the practices at seven, the youngest
at four years of age.</p>

<p>One of the writer’s patients, a young woman of twenty-four years
of age, incipiebat masturbari, tres annos nata, ponendo pulvinum in
femoribus et premendo eum quoad muliebria humescebant.</p>

<p>In Blackmer’s case, a girl eight years of age impudenter se stuprabat
from her fourth year and, at the same time, sollicitans pueros
of ten to twelve years of age ad stuprum. She planned to kill her
parents that she might devote herself completely to such enjoyment.</p>

<p>Zambaco relates the histories of two sisters, one of whom at the
age of seven feminabat cum pueris, corrumpebat sororem, quattuor annos
natam, ad stuprum manu, and at the age of ten was given to the
practice of cunnilingus.</p>

<p>In Moll’s case, a girl of seven had an impulsive inclination to her
brother, three and a half years of age, cujus virilia amabat contrectare
et quem inducebat ad contrectandum muliebria sua.</p>

<p>Jacobi (A. Am. Jour. of Obstetr. 1876, p. 597) relates the history
of a case of a girl of three who, at irregular intervals, had attacks of
stuprum when sitting down. She began by keeping her thighs closely
joined or by crossing her legs. She then started to move and
rub her limbs violently. The face became purple, and there was twitching
about the eyes which looked excited, and the child perspired freely.
After the attack she used to lean back exhausted, sighing and breathing
hurriedly.</p>

<p>In another case Jacobi saw thigh friction, up and down movements,
quick breathing, perspiration, in a female infant of nine months.</p>

<p>Magnan cites a case of a seven-year-old girl who jugiter se stuprabat
with great violence. Even in the moment of being photographed,
she turned up her petticoat and gave herself up to her favorite
pastime.</p>

<p>Rachford (Archive of Pediatry, 1907) has collected 52 cases, 48<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
occurring in female and 4 in male children, of pseudomasturbation, as
he calls it. But since the same symptoms of orgasm, as interrupted
panting respiration, flushed cheeks, redness of face, staring eyes, large
immobile pupils, perspiration and exhaustion are seen in the infant
during its practice, as are found in the masturbating practices of older
children, there is no reason to call these infantile manipulations by any
other name than masturbation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Precocity of sexual activity is usually based upon a neuropathic
predisposition. Such children are, as a rule, tainted
hereditarily. The following case is very instructive on account
of the severity of the attacks and the attending circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Little L’s mother left her husband and went to live with a very
rich man. The child is the product of this concubinage. Some time
after the death of her legal husband, the mother left the father of the
child, deserted the child and married another man. The foundling has
been since taken care of by a children’s aid society. The foster-mother,
with whom the child has been living for the last six months, brought
her to the author for examination, with the following history:</p>

<p>Soon after Mrs. L. received the child she noticed that the same
was suffering from hysterical attacks. It sometimes whined and cried
for several days in succession. It was always very restless and fidgety,
giving the impression as if it was suffering from chorea minor. It was
frequently running to the water-closet without any apparent necessity.
Mrs. L. went to the society to find out what was the matter with the
child and was told there that the child has been a confirmed masturbator
since she was two and a half years old. Two other families, to whom
the child has been successively given for adoption, have returned her
to the society on account of this perversity. She was also told that
if she refused to keep the child, the society will have to send it to an
insane asylum as the last resort. For this reason, Mrs. L., who in
the meantime had become attached to the child, resolved to try to break
up the bad habit before she adopted it. Mrs. L., who is a highly intelligent
lady and seems to possess an unusual power of observation,
describes the attacks as follows:</p>

<p>The usual mode of the child’s practice is volvulam manibus permulcere.
The acme of the attack is manifested by the rigidity
of the entire body, by the panting respiration, the staring eyes, the immobile
pupils, redness of face, perspiration and general excitement.
After a short interval of exhaustion, she gives herself again to her
favorite pastime. In this way the child jugiter stuprum manu faciebat,
even in the presence of others. All punishments by Mrs. L.
and in the institution, where her little hands were even burned with hot
iron, were of no avail. When her hands were tied so that she could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
use them, fricabat muliebria sitting on a chair, by violent circular
motions of her pelvis, which simply frightened her foster-mother. When
lying in bed the child crosses her legs and rubs the thighs violently
against each other.</p>

<p>When the child was asked how it happened to start the performance
of such practices, it answered that it had been first taught by her
unnatural mother ut tractaret matris muliebria stupri causa. Also
the matron of a certain institution is said to have taken the
child into a dark closet et adduxit puellam ad matronæ manustuprum.
The truth of these assertions cannot be proven, but by some experimenting,
undertaken with the child, it has been proven beyond the shadow
of a doubt that some adult woman abusa est puella ad stuprum suum.</p>

<p>The examination of the five-year-old girl shows a bright, nervous
child, pale, with deeply set eyes, surrounded by dark rings, and somewhat
enlarged cervical and inguinal glands. The entire body is covered
with blond soft hair of unusual length. The same long hair covers the
somewhat enlarged labia majora, so that they make the appearance of
that of a girl near puberty. They are quite separated from each other,
as found in the adult. The clitoris is somewhat elongated, but the
prepuce is not adherent to the glans. Otherwise the genitals do not
show any marked anomaly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes the masturbatic practices are provoked by irritation
at the peripheric region. The boy who has the impulse
to touch and pull everything will, if not prevented by mother
or nurse, surely play with his little organ. Sometimes there is
a phimosis or an inflammation of the prepuce, or an accumulation
of smegma in the infant boy; in girls there may be uncleanliness
in the vulva, worms, eczema or pruritus. All these
anomalies cause a certain itching which incites the child to
touching and rubbing these parts. These manipulations produce
an agreeable tickling sensation and awaken the feeling of lust.
This feeling operates in the memory and excites the child to a
state of activity before sexual consciousness has had time to
awaken.</p>

<p>The habit of masturbation is sometimes contracted in infancy,
by the laxness of stupid servants or ignorant mothers.
They often try to calm the infant by tickling the child’s genitals
and thus awaken lustful feelings which later on drives the child
to renew the manipulation without outside help. In this way
masturbation is found in the best and purest homes.</p>

<p>Another practice resorted to by nurse-girls and mothers is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
to amuse the child by gently striking its buttocks, a region
which is highly erogenous. Every one who has read “Les Confessions,”
by Rousseau, knows how this savant, when a boy,
became sexually excited when his nurse punished him by whipping
him on his buttocks. Thus nurses, and even mothers,
innocently induce the child to the habit of masturbation. A
still greater danger lurks from vicious servants and voluptuous
nurse-girls who deliberately handle the infant’s or the very
young child’s lumbus libidinis causa. They touch and strike the
genitals of boys as well as that of girls for their own pleasure.
There are few nurse-girls, says Parke, who do not delight to
initiate the boy, committed to their care, in sexual matters. He
relates many histories of patients who were induced to abnormal
practices by their nurses in early youth. Lawson-Tait, in warning
parents against allowing children to sleep with their nurses
or with servants, says that in every instance where he found a
number of children affected by masturbation, the contagion
could be traced to a servant. Freund relates several examples
of severe youthful hysteria where the starting-point could be
traced to some sexual manipulations by servants, nurse-girls
and governesses.</p>

<p>Sexual precocity is, therefore, not seldom caused by tactile
stimulation. Still in the majority of cases precocity may be
easily traced to a hereditary taint.</p>

<small>ANAESTHESIA</small></h3>


<p>Under the caption of sexual anaesthesia will be treated here
not only the deficiency of sexual emotion or the absence of the
sexual feeling, i. e., the impotence of voluptas or the lack of
erotic desire, but all other deficiencies, declines or abatements
in the realm of sex, such as absence of experiencing satisfaction,
impotency of copulation and of propagation.</p>

<p><i>Etiology of male impotence.</i>—In the etiology of impotence
three main causes must be taken into consideration. Impotence
is almost always met with in congenital or acquired malformation.
Such anomalies lie more in the province of surgery
and need not be considered here any further. Impotence is
also found as a symptom in certain constitutional diseases. The
patients suffering from these troubles, are seeking medical advice
more for their causative anomaly than for the symptom of
impotence, which in these cases is of secondary importance.
Hence the consideration of these cases may also be omitted.
The anomaly of impotence par excellence and for which medical
advice is mostly sought is nervous impotence. This impotence
from nervous collapse is the commonest and complicates all
other kinds.</p>

<p>The patients of this class have always been normal in their
sex-life. Suddenly, one day, they find themselves impotent.
The cause of this kind of impotence is, in the majority of
cases, sexual excesses, and four different kinds of excesses may
be taken into consideration, excesses in copulation, in masturbation,
in mental erethism, or commonly called day-dreaming,
and finally excesses in tactile eroticism, or the common sexual
dalliance or caresses of young lovers.</p>

<p><i>Copulation excesses.</i>—During coition all the parts of the
genital apparatus are in a state of extreme congestion. If
such congestions are too often provoked they have a more or
less deleterious effect upon the organs. Especially the colliculus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and the prostatic portion of the urethra are affected by such
repeated congestions. While the other parts assume their normal
state soon after ejaculation and the cessation of erection,
the colliculus remains still in a state of turgescence for some
time. Now, the prostatic urethra is very rich in sensible
nerves, and by its congestion all the generative organs are kept
in a state of erethism. The irritation of this area is also
capable of deranging the spinal genital centres. It either increases
excitability and causes ejaculatio praecox, or it decreases
excitability, and erections are no longer evoked.</p>

<p>Besides affecting the special nerves, the repeated orgasm,
through the mental vertigo, the muscular convulsion, the cardiac
and respiratory excitement, must lead to nervous disorders. As
a matter of fact, venereal excesses are followed by malaise,
nervousness, mental depression, lassitude, fatigue, satiety, heaviness
in the head, disposition to sleep, dulness of intellect, indisposition
to exercise, want of decision, regrets and ill humor,
and the other symptoms of general neurasthenia.</p>

<p><i>Masturbatic excesses.</i>—Still excesses in copulation are not
so harmful as excesses in masturbation. In the first place excesses
in copulation are self-limited. Indulgence in intercourse
requires the consent of the partner, and where a second person
is needed, there is always a limit put to the will of the first
party. Furthermore, excesses in coition require each time a
complete erection, and abused nature will finally deny erections.
If the young and vigorous individual should in the beginning
be able to command quite a number of erections in one night,
after a certain time, he will be glad if he could have one complete
erection during a night, or even once a week. In this
way Nature herself regulates such excesses and takes care that
“the trees should not sweep the stars down.”</p>

<p>The case is different with masturbation. No limit is set
here to the excesses. Self-abuse does not require cooperation
of a second person, and what is of more importance, erection
is not requisite. Thus even Nature is here powerless. Hence
when there is a propensity to masturbatory excesses, there is
nothing to prevent the individual from abusing its favorite
pastime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>Besides the harm to the greater frequency, excesses in masturbation
offers additional injury through the youth of the
individual. Copulation excesses are indulged in by individuals
after puberty, i. e., by persons with fully developed generative
organs and in full virility. The practice of masturbation, on
the other hand, is often begun by mere children, before the
genital organs have had time to fully develop, and it is easily
seen that excesses will cause greater damage to these undeveloped
organs. Hence when young individuals are given to
inordinate masturbation, they harm the organs in a higher
degree than excesses in copulation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, ejaculation in masturbation is forced through
purely local manipulation. There is only a local excitation of the
nerves. The help of the psyche and phantasy is missing, and
the lumbar centres are tasked to the utmost. When the masturbator
tries to supply the psychic means, he relies on the
fertility and the extravagance of the lewd images which he
presents to his mind to increase the libido. Hence masturbation
is more injurious because it is generally effected through
the influence of an exalted imagination.</p>

<p>Very soon the masturbator discovers that visions, once sufficient
to produce the requisite excitement, have lost their power,
and that the images need to be of a more extravagant salacity.
In this way, the masturbator accustoms himself to extraordinary
means of sexual gratification, so that attempts of normal copulation
are no longer successful. When he attempts coition, he
finds that reality is so much less than his imagination has led
him to believe and that it is incapable of rousing his appetite.</p>

<p>Another injury done to the character of the masturbator
is the guilty conscience. Almost every masturbator seems to
feel that his acts degrade his manhood.<a id="FNanchor_AR_44" href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">AR</a> He seems to know
by intuition that his practice is injurious to his health and is
morally wrong, because it is not in accord with the general
plan of the creative power in the universe. Still in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
himself, he continues to indulge in it. The will seems to have
entirely lost its control. The masturbator is thus engaged in a
conflict between moral conviction and sensual indulgence. Herein
lies one of the most harmful effects of masturbation. It is
undermining the individual’s will-power and destroying his
character. Every masturbator resolves again and again, after
each exercise, to resist henceforth the inclination and to overcome
the temptation,<a id="FNanchor_AS_45" href="#Footnote_AS_45" class="fnanchor">AS</a> each time with the same futile result.
A paralyzing sensation arises in him, a feeling of shame and
self-contempt overtakes him, because he has again failed to
show enough energy, has again been too weak to resist the
impulse. Finally these disturbing and paralyzing sensations
give rise to the conviction of his being lacking in will-power
and to the feeling of being generally deficient in everything
else in life. In this way, excesses in masturbation harm the
generative organs not only directly but also indirectly by first
injuring the individual’s entire nervous system, and the different
kinds of impotencies are only symptoms of the general
neurasthenia.</p>

<p><i>Mental erethism.</i>—The other kind of sexual excesses, those
of mental erethism and frustrate eroticism, are even more harmful
than excesses in copulation and masturbation.</p>

<p>By mental erethism or, as it is generally called, or rather
misnamed, mental masturbation, is understood the filling of
the phantasy with lascivious pictures. The dreamers give themselves
up to sensual thoughts, allowing the mind to dwell constantly
on sexual ideas, or erotic subjects of connubial enjoyments,
conjuring before the unruly imagination extravagant and
voluptuous visions and bawdry portrayals. The mind is fixed
on images of individuals of the other sex, all in lustful posi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>tions,
on pictures of the nude and of their genitals and of
couples in actione coeundi.</p>

<p>The voluptuous day-dreamers, not needing material manipulation,
may busy themselves with their favorite thoughts while
seemingly conversing with their friends or on the most solemn
occasions, as when listening to a sermon, etc. These erogenous
thoughts, these libidinous images, these constant broodings on
sex-matters create a habit which secures such a hold upon the
individual that he cannot overcome it. The habit becomes so
rooted in some instances that it is impossible for the patients
to free their thoughts from fancies and pictures of lustful situations,
while alone. Not even with the greatest efforts are they
able to rid themselves from imagining erotic scenes of various
kinds. Their minds are constantly preoccupied with a single
engrossing subject to the exclusion of all other topics and are
perpetually turned on sexual subjects, so that they are unable
to concentrate their attention upon any other matters.</p>

<p>These perennial broodings on sex subjects keep the genital
organs in a permanent state of sexual excitation and erethism.
While in masturbation the material congestion of the generative
organs is removed with each ejaculation, in mental erethism
relief by ejaculation is missing. In the first stage of the vicious
habit, the morbid mental lubricity and the lascivious unlicensed
thoughts may occasionally provoke an ejaculation. But later
on, when the genitals have undergone a certain weakness, ejaculation
is not brought on any longer by these images, and the
genital organs remain in a continual state of material congestion
and nervous tension. In this way not only the colliculus
and prostratic urethra, as in excesses of copulation and masturbation,
but all the genital organs are in a state of chronic
inflammation, which in time becomes the cause of impotence.</p>

<p><i>Tactile eroticism.</i>—Worse than mental erethism is tactile
eroticism. By tactile eroticism is understood, keeping the
genital organs constantly irritated by dalliance with individuals
of the other sex, stopping short of the act of copulation. On
a walk through the city parks, any summer evening, or on a
trip on the Sunday excursion boats, young men and women
may be observed lying in each other’s arms in a continual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
caress, kissing, hugging, and fondling each other for hours,
scarcely confining themselves within the limit of decency. These
couples are actually exercising the sexual act, although they do
not obtain sexual congress. These tremors and ecstasies, these
amorous ardors and intoxications, these sensual joys which
stimulate with rapture the higher centres and infuse the mind
with sexual gratification, are all a part of the chain of the
sexual act. The interruption of this chain of impulses short
of copulation may satisfy the moral conscience of the young
people, but it does not make such excesses less injurious. On
the contrary, the generative organs are deprived of the relief
which ejaculation lends to these organs. The genital tube remains
surcharged with blood, and the hyperaemia subsides but
slowly. The normal outlet of the sex-activity has been cut off
by a special process of repression. If these frustrate stimulations
are frequently repeated, they perpetuate the genital congestion,
and through the retention of the secretions, a catarrh
of the genital organs ensues, just as inflammations often originate
in the mammary glands through the accumulation of the milk
after weaning the child.</p>

<p>These perennial congestions are the cause of prostatic inflammations
not seldom met with in young men who never
were infected by gonorrhoea. The ulcerations of the cervix
so often found in young girls and young mothers of one child
may often be attributed to no other cause than to frustrate
eroticism in the young girls and to onanism<a id="FNanchor_AT_46" href="#Footnote_AT_46" class="fnanchor">AT</a> in the young
mothers. The cervix is damaged in the same way as the soil,
burned by the sun, in the absence of a beneficent rain, cracks
and slits.</p>

<p>The frequently repeated engorgements of the blood vessels
which do not receive the normal physiological relief by ejaculation
provoke in both parties an exaggerated sex-sense and
produce the emotions, known as satyriasis in men and as
nymphomania in women. The exaggeration is followed later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
on by exhaustion of the libidinous impulses, and the men become
hypochondriacs and impotent and women neurotic and
shallow.</p>

<p>The continual congestion in the genitals causes also a continued
feeling of heaviness and discomfort in the lower abdomen.
Urination becomes frequent in both sexes, and in women menstruation
is irregular. The patients complain of profuse pains
in the back, legs, sides, and of weakness, nervousness and sleeplessness.
These troubles cause general debility and a complete
breakdown of the nervous system.</p>

<p>The generative centres are particularly damaged by the
constant congestion of the genitals. The frequent stimuli keep
the lumbar centres in a condition of constant irritation. The
nervous system, presiding over the function of erection, thus
becomes worn out and exhausted, and the nerves do not respond
even to the strongest stimulations, which would otherwise set
them in action. In this way, the centres get accustomed, so to
say, of not responding any longer with erection to the proper
stimuli, or in other words, the consensualism between the genital
nerves and their centres is broken.</p>

<p>Hence, besides the harm done to the nerves by the general
debility, there is great damage done to the genital nerves and
centres by the break in the chain of the reflex mechanism. In
no other sex-activity, except in actual copulation, are the generative
organs in such a constant and intense excitement as in
dalliance with individuals of the other sex, no other erotic
stimuli create such libidinous turgescence of the organs and
such a high degree of sex-tension, exciting with rapture the
higher centres, no other excitations cause such a consumption
of nerve power as this gratification of the impulse of contrectation
by tactile manoevres. The erections of penis and clitoris
are vigorous and violent. The organs are set in a state of
expectancy for the final act. If the act is not terminated within
a certain limited time, the state of expectancy cannot last for
ever. The mode of action is limited in length of time. Except
in the abnormal state, known as priapism, the duration of erection
is relatively short in the normal individual. Its beginning
is synchronous with the onset of the material congestion and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
nervous tension of the genital parts, and its subsidence should
normally be synchronous with ejaculation. If the latter be prevented,
erection has to cease sooner or later, even when congestion
and tension remain unabated. Hence after long and
lasting amorous caresses the erections fail.</p>

<p>If these manœuvres are often repeated, the excitations finally
do not effect the proper response, and erection fails from the
outset. The strong and continuous stimulations render the
nerves and their centres inert in reaction and weak in power.
The centres of erection and ejaculation become blunted, the
inhibitory centres get very sensitive, and erection cannot be
provoked. When the nerve centres presiding over the function
of erection get into the habit of not responding to the highest
excitations of the tactile stimuli, they do not respond even to
the stimulations concarnationis. The cooperating nerve-apparatus
has been affected, and a perverted innervation is created.
The close interdependence of the mechanism of erection and the
centres is removed, and an abnormal reflex-excitability is produced.
The consensualism between the corpora cavernosa and
the centre of erection is interrupted.</p>

<p>Before the indulgence in frustrate caresses has become a
habit, i. e., in the beginning of the practice, erections are
vigorous and of considerable duration. But the duration diminishes
with each repetition. After a few months or years of
these nerve-destroying practices, according to the patient’s
nervous constitution, there is no response by erection even to
the strongest stimuli. The consentaneous action, which, otherwise,
connects the excitement of the organs with erection and
completion of the act, does not take place. This lack of consensualism
on the part of the several factors which go to make
up the orgasm leads finally to complete impotence.</p>

<p>Continence, if long continued, has been claimed to be the
cause of impotence. But there is no valid reason for this
belief. To prove the harmfulness of continence, an analogue
is brought forward between the atrophy of a muscle in enforced
idleness and the injury to the sex organs in enforced abstinence.
But the proof is somewhat feeble. The essential organs of
generation are not muscles but glands, and who has ever heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
of a tear gland atrophying for lack of crying. Furthermore,
abstinence does not condemn the generative organs to absolute
rest. Every individual, especially when abstinent, has frequently
nocturnal erections through the entire period of his
sexual activity, and there is no reason why such erections should
not keep the genitals in the required exercise and should not
prevent the alleged atrophy. As far as the exercise to prevent
atrophy is concerned, nocturnal erections ought to be of the
same service as erections followed by intromissions. The nocturnal
erections seem to be even more harmless. The engorgement
of the colliculus is less pronounced in these erections.
Micturition, on awakening with an erection, is immediately
possible, while there is a pronounced inability of micturition
after an erection and ejaculation either through initu aut stupro
manu.</p>

<p>The histories of patients are cited to prove the deleterious
effects of total abstinence. Cases are known of alleged abstinent
neurasthenics, on the point of a complete breakdown, who
recovered perfect health after marriage. But even this proof
cannot stand a closer scrutiny. Who can prove the total abstinence
of these patients? The layman is prone to regard the
actual intromission only as sexual activity. If he has abstained
from this final phase, he considers himself abstinent. But
chastity is not continence by any means. Absolute continence
is abstinence not only from the gratification of the impulse of
detumescence concarnatione, but also from that of contrectation,
i. e., from mental and tactile caresses and from all other
abnormal practices. We must distinguish between chastity and
abstinence. Those who are chaste out of fear of venereal infection
or for lack of opportunity are not always abstinent.
They are just the individuals who are indulging immoderately
in mental erethism or even masturbation.</p>

<p>The mere assertion of the patient that he never indulged
in unnatural practices does not count. The patient’s veracity
is very questionable. All venereal troubles seem to exert an
inhibitory influence upon the truth-centres. The propensity of
the masturbator to conceal the truth is notorious. If such a
patient claims that he has never masturbated, it is likely that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
he is still practising it. A special psychical element, associated
with this habit, prompts the majority of patients to gross and
intemperate prevarication.</p>

<p>But even if such a “rara avis,” who has abstained from
actual manusturpation, should exist, still mental erethism cannot
entirely be excluded. The elicitation of a history of mental
erethism is connected with great difficulty. Masturbation with
these patients means only the indulgence in manual practices;
the voluptuous day-dreams are considered of no account, and
the peculiar type of mendacity prevents them from revealing
the truth even to him, upon whom they called to consult.</p>

<p>Hence the loss of sexual power in these patients may not
have been effected by continence but, on the contrary, by continual
erethism. The examination of such patients really shows,
as a rule, the prostatic urethra in a state, which is usually caused
by prolonged erethism. After marriage, with its regulated
sexual activity and the removal of the inclination to the wild
erotic fancies, the neurasthenia is soon cured, not because the
patient has given up abstinence, as interpreted by the anti-abstinence
advocates, but, on the contrary, because he has now
become real abstemious from the excesses of mental erethism.
Hence the cure of neurasthenia by marriage is no proof against
sexual abstinence. The patients who seek medical advice for
their neurasthenic troubles may be those who have only abstained
from coition but have freely and immoderately indulged in the
unnatural modes of sensualism, whence their troubles originated.
The real continent individuals who avoid any kind of erotic
practices remain sound and healthy and do not require medical
help. Their cases remain hence unknown to the profession.</p>

<p>If total abstainers from every kind of sexual erethism
should sometimes become neurasthenic, this fact would not
prove yet that the nervous trouble was caused by total abstinence
from the gross sexual gratification. Even the man about town
may become neurasthenic for lack of the gratification of the
impulse of permanent mating. The apologists of promiscuous
intercourse forget or are ignorant of the fact that the impulse
of permanent mating in normal men and women cannot be
satisfied by promiscuity. The craving for a permanent mate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
home and family unconsciously demands gratification even from
him who leads a promiscuous sexual life. If this impulse is
not gratified, as in cranky old bachelors or hysterical old maids,
it may lead to severe attacks of neurasthenia. Such cases will
not be cured by the association with venal women or by promiscuous
sensuality, but they may be cured by a permanent
mate, home, and family life. Hence the cure of the total abstainer
from his nervousness by marriage is again no proof
against total abstinence. The cause of the trouble may have
been the unsatisfied impulse of permanent mating which has
been now satisfied by marriage. Promiscuous relations would
not have cured the neurasthenia, but marriage with its accompanying
emotional tones.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no valid proof of the harmfulness of
total abstinence in a healthy individual without a hereditary
taint. If total abstinence ever harmed anybody, the patient
was either a congenial weakling or has acquired his lack of
resistance through indulgence in early eroticism. A perfectly
healthy man is never injured by abstinence. At least there is
no sufficient proof that it ever did. But there are unmistakable
proofs that total abstinence does not harm the individual. The
best proof is furnished by many chaste and healthy women.
Few women seem to suffer from total abstinence. The rejoinder
that woman’s sexual desires are very feeble, that the
female sex has no sexual needs, that it is more or less frigid,
are mere masculine assertions without objective proofs. Women
writers, who ought to know best the feelings of their own sex,
claim just the opposite. Johanna Elberskirchen (in Sexualempfindung
bei Weib und Mann) has well satirized the masculine
impertinence which tries to teach woman what her emotions are
or are not. The fact that many a young woman runs the risk,
in the present state of sex-morality, of ruining her entire future
by the indulgence in extra-marital sexuality, under conditions
where pecuniary or other considerations are entirely out of the
question, would tend to show that the sexual impulse is by
no means so weak in women, as many would lead us to believe.
It is simply incomprehensible that the female sexual needs
should be less urgent than those of the male sex. Woman has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
by far the greater part of labor in the sex-performance. With
the ejaculation the man’s biological part is at an end. He
may leave now the scene of his activity, while the woman’s
part just begins and is continued through nine months of pregnancy
and about a year of nursing of the new being. Dr. M.
Glasgow, as a woman perfectly competent to judge, says (Review
of Reviews, 1912, p. 319): “The strong sexuality displayed
by a sex whose contribution to the germ of the race is discharged
in a brief moment of enjoyment must be greatly less
than exhibited by the other party, whose contribution is made
through long months of patient endurance.” The prominent
part woman takes in the propagation of the race forces to the
logical conclusion that her erotic needs are of necessity stronger,
although, as Ellen Key puts it, they may be calmer than that
of man’s. Woman is able in a quite extraordinary way to
produce the impression that she herself is really non-sexual
and that her sexuality is only a concession to man. But the
seeming reluctance of the female is intended to increase the
sexual activity in both mates. The passivity of the female
throughout nature is only apparent, it is the passivity of the
magnet. As a matter of fact, women experience during the
orgasm an ecstasy of feeling greater than in men, involving
the whole system in an ecstatic nervous erethism.</p>

<p>Still the normal woman can stand absolute continued continence
without any injury to her body and mind (e. g. nuns).
Hence there is no reason why the human male, if left to himself,
and nothing comes to disturb the natural course of his
sexual development, should be harmed by abstinence. Until
the impulse of permanent mating enters into play, and this
comes relatively late in life, abstinence will harm neither men
nor women, if they live in an atmosphere free from the influence
of artificial stimulation.</p>

<p>If the animal kingdom could be taken as proof for or
against total abstinence in man, we find that pet animals, as
canary birds or dogs, who rarely have the opportunity to exercise
their sexual powers, are generally as healthy and live as
long as those living in freedom.</p>

<p>Hence the claim that abstinence is the cause of impotence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
has absolutely no ground to stand upon. If the young man
kept his thoughts pure and avoided exciting amusements which
create emotional disturbances, impotence would be an unusual
occurrence. If the young woman would avoid puttering over
her genitalia, pelvic obsession with its accompanied hysterical
conditions of hyperesthetic or paresthetic erethism would be
rarely met with.</p>

<p>The only cause for impotence remains sexual excesses.
They are very seldom the immediate cause of the impotence.
But they leave such weakness in the genital organs and in the
nervous system that it requires only the least disturbance to
provoke total impotence. Such disturbances, as remorse over
the formerly committed irregularities, or distrust in one’s
powers, or the mental attitude of the woman to whom sexual
approaches are a matter of real or assumed indifference, are
sufficient to render the weakened neurotic man total impotent.</p>

<p>Next to excesses, gonorrhoea, in a great many cases, leaves
the genitals in a similar weakened condition. Gonorrhoea often
causes acute inflammation of the prostatic urethra, and the
mucous membrane not seldom undergoes the changes characteristic
of chronic catarrh. The sensory nerves reflexly keep
the centres for erection and ejaculation in a condition of hyperesthesia.
This condition finally leads to the paralysis of
the centres and nerves, and reflex-erection cannot be produced.</p>

<p>Psychic causes of impotence are mental fatigue, overwork,
preoccupation with mathematical or financial problems, fear,<a id="FNanchor_AU_47" href="#Footnote_AU_47" class="fnanchor">AU</a>
anger, grief, and disgusting sights or odors. Prolonged excitement
before attempting coition may also lead to temporary
impotence.</p>

<p>The other causes of impotence are the symptomatic ones.
Impotence is met with in tabes dorsalis, diabetes, nephritis,
obesitas, oxalic diathesis, haemorrhoids, fissures of the anus,
seat worms, etc. Excesses in the consumption of certain drugs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
may also lead to impotence. Such drugs are alcohol,<a id="FNanchor_AV_48" href="#Footnote_AV_48" class="fnanchor">AV</a> morphine,
cocaine, tobacco and the bromides.</p>

<p><i>Etiology of impotence in women.</i>—The same causes, at work
in producing impotence in men, are also affecting impotence in
women. The only modification lies in the fact that impotence of
copulation, which is the impotence par excellence in men, is of a
negligible quantity in women. The main mode of impotence
found in women is that of experiencing libido. This impotence
may be either idiopathic or also caused by excesses as the impotence
of copulation in men. Idiopathic impotence of libido
is oftener met with in women than in men. Still even in
women this insensibility is much rarer than is generally believed.
The explanation for the greater frequency of impotence
of libido in women than in men has first been given by
Freud (Sig. Drei Abhandlungen über Sexualtheorie).</p>

<p>The autoerotic activity of the erogenous zones in children
is the same in both sexes. It may be asserted, says Freud,
that the sexuality of the little girl has entirely a male character.
The chief erogenous zone in the female child is the
clitoris which is homologous to the male penis. The frequent
spontaneous discharges of sexual excitement in little girls
manifest themselves in twitching and erections of the clitoris.
But while in the male the erogenous zone remains the same
after puberty as before, namely in the penis, puberty is distinguished
in the girl by a wave of repression of the clitoris-sexuality
and in the change of the erogenous zones. The rôle of
the clitoris is henceforth to conduct the excitation to the adjacent
parts. It often takes some time to affect this transference.
During this time the young woman remains anaesthetic
to stimulations of the internal organs as vagina or cervix.
This anaesthesia may become permanent if the clitoris zone
refuses to transfer its excitability. This anaesthesia in women
is often only apparent and local. They are anaesthetic at the
vagina and cervix, but not at all unexcitable through the clitoris
or even through other erogenous zones, such as the lips or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
nipples. The women are impotent of experiencing libido in
coition but potent when the clitoris is excited by any other
stimuli.</p>

<p>The refusal to transfer the clitoris sexuality is, as a rule,
caused by an excessive irritation of the clitoris by manusturpation
during childhood. The excesses which cause impotence of
libido in women are the same which cause impotence of copulation
in men, namely excesses in copulation, masturbation, mental
erethism, and tactile eroticism. In women the excesses in
copulation are more harmful than in men. While in men
these excesses are self-limited by the impossibility of provoking
any erections, after a certain time of continuous indulgence;
in women there is no limitation to the practice. Playing the
passive rôle, she can stand congressum continuum for a considerable
length of time and tire out a number of men in
succession. The vaginal pavement-epithelial lining is very
strong.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Conteritur ferrum, silices teneantur ab usu.</div>
  <div class="verse">“Sufficit et damni pars caret illa metu.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>sings Ovid in his “Ars Amandi.” Hence when a woman has
any proclivity for excesses in initu, there is no natural limit
to her indulgence. Through the influence of the frequent
irritation in copulative excesses, the vaginal mucous membrane
undergoes considerable changes. It becomes a veritable skin, a
stiff parchment, and thus loses sensitiveness.</p>

<p>The other cause for impotence of libido are excesses in
masturbation. The evil results of these practices in women
are fully as great as in men, although with women it is the
orgasm alone that does the damage, since there is no seminal
discharge or loss of vital fluids. Through the frequent application
of friction to the parts, they become first hypersensitive
and later hyposensitive and non-responsive to normal excitations.
Accustomed to excite the genitals by manual stimuli,
which may be kept up for a considerable length of time, the
masturbator is, later on, impotent to reach the acme through
the normal, relatively short excitations, as they take place
through the internal organic events in the genitals in normal
sex-activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>In women, the same as in men, the greater damage through
excesses in masturbation is done by the greater frequency, because
it requires no help, from an outsider, because it is not
bound by time and locality, and may be practised by the undeveloped
child, and last but not least, because of the constant
conflict and struggle of the masturbator between the sensual
impulse and the inability to desist and the feeling of womanly
unworthiness, dissatisfaction and shame.</p>

<p>Excesses in mental erethism and excessive dalliance with
members of the other sex have no less injurious effects in
women than in men. In the long run these excesses cause in
the woman a number of nervous troubles which take the form
of hysteria or assume the character of neurasthenia. These
excessive practices of erethism or tactile eroticism are, also in
women, worse than excesses in copulation and masturbation,
because the former do not lead to the orgasm and to the relief
of the nervous tension and material congestion.</p>

<p>Another cause of impotence of libido in women is onanism
or the practice of withdrawal. This coitus interruptus which
rarely leads to orgasm in the woman, has the same effect upon
her as excessive mental erethism or tactile eroticism, because
it does not lead to relief from the nervous tension and the
congestion. Excesses in onanism are, therefore, very harmful
in women, while they are of lesser consequence in men. The
repeated congestions of the parts in all these practices lead
first to chronic hyperaemia and stasis, and in its further progress
to chronic inflammations of the tissues, known under the respective
names of metritis, perimetritis, parametritis, endometritis,
salpingitis, and ovaritis. The inflammations constantly
irritate the nerves and their centres and in this way blunt
their normal sensibility. Besides the dulling of the nervous
elements, these conditions give rise to great pain in commixtione,
and pain and fear are the greatest enemies of libido.</p>

<p>Other causes of impotence of libido in women are excesses
in alcohol, bromides, cocaine, morphine and other narcotics and
stimulants. Sometimes impotence of libido is the result of a
hard confinement. During such confinements extensive lesions
in the erectile tissues of the bulbs and in the sphincter cunni<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
muscles are apt to occur. Now, the integrity of the vaginal bulbs,
of the sphincter cunni, of the intermediary net of vessels, and
of the clitoris is necessary for the normal experiencing of libido.
If a serious lesion occurs, the blood current is interrupted, and
the blood is prevented from leaving the bulbs and from entering
the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris. The following case
will serve as an illustration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, twenty years of age, married twenty months, has a
baby ten months old. She states that since her confinement she has no
libido during coition. Before this event she always found perfect gratification.
The examination shows a first-degree laceration of the
perineum.</p></blockquote>

<p>Absence or smallness of the clitoris and an adherent prepuce
may also often diminish the feeling of libido.</p>

<p><i>Pathology of male impotence.</i>—The minute penetration
into the different causes of sexual anaesthesia in the preceding
pages was of particular importance, in order to fully understand
the pathology of the different kinds of impotence.</p>

<p>The accomplishment of the physiological act of copulation
and impregnation requires from the man the possession,
first of the desire to associate with the other sex, or of the
instinct of voluptas,<a id="FNanchor_AW_49" href="#Footnote_AW_49" class="fnanchor">AW</a> secondly the power of effecting intromission
or the potency of erection, thirdly the potency of ejaculating
a healthy sperma for impregnation, and finally it requires
that libido or pleasure accompanies the emission to assure the
repetition of the act.</p>

<p>From these requirements it follows that the individual
must command over four potencies, the potency of voluptas,
which compels the individual to seek the society of the other
sex, the potentia coeundi, which depends upon strong normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
erections, the potentia generandi, depending upon normal secreting
testicles, and upon the perviousness of the entire seminal
canal, from the testicle to the meatus of the urethra, and finally
over the potency of libido, which depends upon the intact centripetal
nerves and normal centres of generation in the brain.
If any of these potencies are missing, the individual will be
impotent. Hence four kinds of impotencies may be distinguished
in both sexes:</p>

<p>(1) The impotence of voluptas, or the absence of sexual
desire.</p>

<p>(2) The impotence of immission, or absence of the power
of erection in men and the anomalies at the entrance into the
vagina in women.</p>

<p>(3) The impotence of impregnation, or the absence of
spermatozoa in men and of ova in women.</p>

<p>(4) The impotence of libido, or absence of the ability to
experience pleasure at the moment of emission.</p>

<p><i>Impotence of voluptas.</i>—The impotence of voluptas, or
male frigidity, unassociated with the two other impotencies of
copulation and impregnation, is very rare in men.</p>

<p>Physiological impotence of voluptas exists in childhood and
in old age. In the latter period the desires disappear pari
passu with the power. Although the feeling of desire is of
purely mental origin, the generative organs playing only a
secondary part, still when these organs are powerless or absent,
the desire is generally also absent.</p>

<p>Impotence of voluptas is found in eunuchs and in castrates,<a id="FNanchor_AX_50" href="#Footnote_AX_50" class="fnanchor">AX</a>
who have been operated upon before puberty. Such
castrates, even if the penis has not been removed, show not only
impotentia coeundi, but also complete frigidity. Their habitus
and feelings differ entirely from those of normal men. Castrates,
who have been operated upon later in life, retain the
habitus of normal men and also the impulse of contrectation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
The potency of immission is even greatly enhanced, at least
for the first few years after the operation. In normal men
erection subsides immediately after the ejaculation. In eunuchs
ejaculation does not take place. Hence the erections may last
for hours or even days. In the course of time the potentia
coeundi even of these castrates begins also to decrease and later
on becomes entirely extinct.</p>

<p>Impotence of voluptas is also found in severe cases of
neurasthenia, where the entire nervous system is in a low state
of efficiency. The history of the following case may serve to
illustrate the symptoms of the neurasthenic impotence of
voluptas.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. B., 35 years of age, unmarried, had gonorrhoea several times,
never lues. Since puberty until about two years ago he was a typical
rounder and had an abundance of femininity at his disposal. He is now
suffering from general debility and shows all the symptoms of severe
neurasthenia, as headaches, pains in the back and abdomen, dyspepsia,
constipation, anorexia, insomnia, etc. In addition he has lost all desire
for sexual gratification. While in the days of unimpaired vigor his
sensual activities were of great frequency, several initus almost every
day, at present the necessity for concarnatio is entirely lacking. When
he does associate cum muliere, erection and ejaculation are perfectly
normal, but the sense of libido is greatly diminished. Sese injungit
nowadays only once every three to four months, out of curiosity to
try his potency, but not because he feels any necessity for the same.</p></blockquote>

<p>The case is thus one of pure male frigidity combined with
a certain diminution of libido.</p>

<p>Male frigidity or impotence of voluptas is also found among
psychopathics, as low idiots and cretins. These patients lack
the understanding of the opposite sex. No mental excitations
will, therefore, have any effect upon them.</p>

<p>Sexual perversion is another psychosis connected with impotency
of voluptas to the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Impotence of voluptas is also often found in dementia.
Sometimes impotence of voluptas is congenital with an individual
otherwise normal. The impotence is then analogous to colorblindness.
Such cases are exceedingly rare.</p>

<p><i>Impotence of libido.</i>—Similar to impotence of voluptas is
the impotence of libido. Here the desire is powerful, the erec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>tions
are vigorous, yet ejaculation takes place without the usual
accompanied libido. It is analogous to the loss or impairment
of the sense of taste. Idiopathic impotence of libido in
men is very rare. It is mostly found as a symptom of some
other anomaly.</p>

<p>Impotence of libido exists in cases of loss of testicles, as
in castrates and eunuchs.</p>

<p>As a rule, impotence of libido is met with in men who
have severely over-taxed their brains and hence are less impressionable
than when in a normal state of health. The impotency
is an indication of an exhausted brain where the
centres for experiencing libido reside.</p>

<p>Sometimes the centripetal nerves which serve for transmission
of the pleasurable sensations to the centres have their
impressionability obtunded by excesses in venere. When the
nerves are deranged, the desire is strong, the erectile power is
sufficient, the mind is in concurrence, emission occurs at the
right moment, yet scarcely a vestige of pleasurable sensation is
experienced during emission. The following case may serve as
a proper illustration of the nature of this anomaly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. X., fifty years of age, was seduced to the practice of manusturpation
when about thirteen years old. The exercises were carried out
daily. After puberty, from about sixteen to nineteen years of age, he
was given less to these practices, still once a week he could not resist
of indulging in his favorite pastime. At this time he began to associate
with meretricious women. This activity alternated with manusturpation
until he was forty years old. There were periods of months or
even years, while living in localities where the opportunity for normal
sex activity was entirely lacking, when he took refuge to weekly practices
of manusturpation. At the same time he indulged in excesses of
mental erethism. His day-dreams on his long walks and in sleepless
nights were filled with images, all taken from the realm of sex. Sometimes
he also indulged in excesses of tactile eroticism (manibus ludere
cum genitalibus mulierum). At the age of forty he married a very
attractive young woman, and although he is greatly in love with his
wife and two children, who arrived in the course of time, and is leading
a regular sex-life, still the pleasure experienced at the ejaculation is
practically nil. What induces him to still keep up his sexual activity
is to please his young wife.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a case where the three potencies of voluptas, copu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>lation
and procreation are perfectly intact, and where the patient
is only suffering from the impotency of experiencing pleasure
or libido during his sex-activity. In another case the impotency
of libido is complete every time the patient practises coition,
but is less pronounced when the act is repeated within an hour
after the first exercise.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. N., thirty-five years of age, a prominent lawyer, is suffering
from a severe attack of neurasthenia for the last three years, the
greater part of which he spent in sanitaria. As a boy he practised
masturbation to some extent, but quite moderately. The symptoms are
greatly pronounced in the morning, and are manifested by a general
malaise, pressure in the head, bulging of the eyes, tremor of the hands,
pressure in the rectum, in the prostatic region, and burning at the tip
of the penis after urinating. The pressure in the rectum is relieved
the day following coition, but returns in aggravated form on the second
day. At the same time a mucus-like sediment appears in the urine
which, on repeated examinations, showed to consist of oxalate of lime.</p>

<p>For the last few years, ejaculation, in concarnatione, takes
place without any trace of libido. But if the act is repeated within an
hour, the patient experiences some pleasure. For this reason the patient
always exercebat concubitum bis in hora which served to aggravate his
neurosis.</p></blockquote>

<p>In some patients the libido is only diminished. In extreme
narrowness of the prepuce the pleasure incident to sexual
relation is slight. The author had only recently performed on
a man, thirty-two years old, circumcision to cure this anomaly,
although, it is said, that in persons who have been circumcized
for ritual considerations, the libido is much slighter than in those
not circumcized. In the latter, the covering of the glans is
almost a mucous membrane and is very sensitive, while in
circumcized people the covering of the glans is almost a veritable
skin and has lost its finer sensibilities.</p>

<p><i>Impotence of procreation.</i>—The type of impotence, most
frequently met with but rarely complained of by men, is the
impotence of propagation. Almost fifty per cent. of all cases
of absolute sterility in married couples are caused by this
anomaly in men.</p>

<p>Congenital and acquired deformities of the genitals may
often cause impotence of procreation. All castrates, even those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
operated later in life, as the Skoptzies in Russia, are, of course,
impotent for procreation, although if the penis has been left intact,
they are very vigorous sexually, for a certain time, and are
very salacious. Anorchismus, cryptorchismus, atrophy of the testicles,
tumors of the testicles, compression by hydrocele, inflammation,
ossification, tuberculosis, and cancer of the prostate may
cause impotence of procreation without impairing the power of
copulation.</p>

<p>Some epispadias and hypospadias may cause impotence of
procreation. When the opening is very far back, the emission
will take place outside of the vagina.</p>

<p>Aspermia, whether idiopathic or acquired, will always cause
impotence of procreation. In the congenital form of aspermia
all the genital organs seem to functionate normally, still no
ejaculation takes place.</p>

<p>In the acquired form of aspermia both ejaculatory ducts
are obliterated, as a rule, through suppurative prostatitis or
tuberculosis of the prostatic gland. In both diseases the glandular
tissue is frequently destroyed.</p>

<p>Aspermia may also be due to neurasthenia as the following
case may show:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. S., twenty-four years of age, has been treated about two years
previously for nocturnal pollutions. They happened every night once or
twice and weakened the patient in such a degree that he was unable to
perform any kind of work. Electric treatment, hydrotherapeutics, and
some medicinal tonics restored him to health. The pollutions happened
once in three to four weeks only. A year later the patient called again,
this time complaining of weakness in sexual power. After a few weeks’
treatment the improvement was such that the patient was lost sight of.</p>

<p>Six months later the patient returned with the complaint of suffering
from aspermia and lack of orgasm. He is erotic, and he has
strong vigorous erections, but no matter how long he remains in
initu, ejaculation does not take place. The patient falls back from sheer
exhaustion, sometimes mentulato membro, without being able to bring
it to an ejaculation and orgasm.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this case the aspermia is due to a certain nervous weakness
of a neurasthenic nature. The patient has no strictures,
and his testicles are intact.</p>

<p>Aspermia is sometimes found in strictures of the urethra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>In such cases the semen flows backward into the bladder.</p>

<p>In comparison with azoospermia, as a cause of impotence
of procreation, all the other described anomalies are of a great
rarity.</p>

<p>In azoospermia ejaculation and orgasm are perfectly normal,
but the semen shows, under the microscope, the absence of spermatozoa.
Azoospermia is sometimes temporarily found after
excesses in initu aut stupro manu.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="title">CUT XLII.</div>
<img src="images/i_pg191.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><i>Azoospermia.</i><br />
1, Boettcher’s crystals; 2, amyloid bodies; 3, hyaline bodies; 4, lecithin;
5, testicular cells; 6, prostatic epithelium; 7, urethral epithelium.</div>
</div>

<p>Permanent azoospermia is, as a rule, caused by inflammations
of the testicles or of the epididymis. These bilateral inflammations
of the testicles or of the vasa epididymis are almost
always the result of gonorrhoea. The vasa deferentia are obliterated
and impervious. The ejaculated semen consists only
of the secretions of the seminal vesicles, of the prostatic glands
and of the urethral glands.</p>

<p>The spermatozoa being absent, the sperma is much thinner
than in the normal state. The absence of the spermatozoa and
their movements is also the cause why the Boettcher’s crystals
usually form much earlier; they appear within half an hour
after ejaculation and in a considerable amount. They often
cover almost the entire microscopical field. In the normal semen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
the movement of the spermatozoa prevents the early formation
of the crystals; they appear after several hours’ standing and
are fewer in number. The thin azoospermatic semen is more
transparent and watery and contains more epithelia and fat than
normal semen.</p>

<p>The patient is, as a rule, unaware of his anomaly. It is
often discovered after his wife has undergone innumerable treatments
for her supposed sterility. If the anomaly has been caused
by gonorrhoea with the accompanying inflammation of the
testicles, epididymitis, or spermatic funiculitis, the loss is almost
irremediable. The revelation to the couple of their doom
to childlessness is one of the many tragedies played in the
doctor’s office.</p>

<p><i>Impotence of copulation.</i>—The anomaly, most complained
of, which drives the patient to seek medical help is the impotence
of copulation. It is the anomaly which strikes the hardest
blow to masculine vanity. It is a psychological fact that most
men are proud of their potency of copulation and feel greatly
humiliated when the same is impeded. A woman will not seldom
discuss with her friends the double ovariotomy performed upon
her, but the man deprived of his testicles will never mention
the fact of his castration to his closest friends.</p>

<p>The impotence of copulation is best divided into four types:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1) Organic impotence.</p>

<p>2) Symptomatic, or paralytic impotence.</p>

<p>3) Psychic, a) transitory, b) relative, c) temporary impotence.</p>

<p>4) Atonic impotence.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Organic impotence</i> may be congenital or acquired. Among
the congenital forms are total absence of the penis. Smallness
of the penis may also be the cause of impotence, although this
cause has been somewhat exaggerated by most writers. The male
generative organs on the Greek statues are in comparison with
the size of the other parts quite small. Still, if the smallness
goes beyond a certain degree it will cause impotence. In the
same way enlargement of the penis beyond a certain degree will
also result in impotence. Adhesions of the penis to the neighboring
parts or torsion of the penis will render intromission im<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>possible.
Congenital absence of the testicles is always accompanied
by loss of power.</p>

<p>Among the acquired deformities are counted neoplasms of
the penis, elephantiasis, and the destruction of the penis through
ulceration. Syphilis and tuberculosis of the testicles are generally
destructive to virility. Removal of the testicles, even if
operated later in life, is, after a certain time, followed by atrophy
of the penis and impotence. Indurations and ossifications of
the cavernous bodies lead, as a rule, to impotence.</p>

<p><i>Symptomatic impotence.</i>—The organic type of impotence is
relatively very rare. The other type, symptomatic impotence,
is oftener met with. It is found in cerebral diseases, diabetes,
tabes dorsalis, chronic nephritis, extreme obesitas, chronic rheumatism,
chronic alcoholism and in the cachexies of anaemia,
cholaemia and uraemia. But since the desire fails with the
failure of power, such patients rarely seek medical aid for this
anomaly. They consult the physician for their original ailment
which is of far greater importance to them than the loss of
power. They mention this anomaly only in the course of the
anamnesis.</p>

<p>Symptomatic impotence is, as a rule, paralytic in form.
Libido is more or less absent, and if emissions ever occur they
take place without erection or pleasure. In the paralytic form
of impotence nocturnal erections are absent, nor do erections
occur at any other time. This sign is almost pathognomonic of
this type. If the vagina is very wide, and intromission with
semi-erection should be effected, ejaculation does not come in
jets but slowly. The function of the bulbo-cavernosus muscle is
impaired, hence no ejaculation with force in a jet is possible, but
a slow dribbling from the meatus takes place.</p>

<p>In paralytic impotence the genitals are more or less withered.
The skin of penis and scrotum is almost anaesthetic.
The entire urethra is insensible, the sound passes into the bladder
with the greatest ease. The skin of the thigh in the vicinity
of the genitals is more sensitive to electric currents than that
of penis and scrotum. The following history well illustrates a
typical case of paralytic symptomatic impotence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. H., 45 years of age, a widower with one child, contracted lues
fifteen years previously and was apparently cured after two years’ treatment.
For the last two to three years he began to suffer from shooting
pains around the abdomen (Gürtelschmerz) and in his legs. Micturition
is frequently urging, and the stream is slow. The knee-jerks are greatly
exaggerated. The patient’s gait is still normal, and he does not show
any other sign of tabes dorsalis. About the time when the pains first
appeared, he also noticed a certain weakness in erection and premature
ejaculation. He began then to associate with meretricious women who
practised on him fellatricia, or insertio fascini in os. From this
time the impotence increased and is now complete. For the last two
years he never had even nocturnal erections. The penis is in a state
of atrophy, and is now of the size of a boy’s, fourteen to fifteen years
of age. The skin of the penis is shriveled and cold. The glans is pale.
The entire skin of the penis and scrotum is quite anaesthetic to the
galvanic current. An application of about fifteen milliamperes in
strength, which produced an ulceration by burning, was scarcely felt by
the patient. The faradic reaction is normal.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Psychic impotence.</i>—The mode of impotence known as
psychic is a very frequent anomaly. It is the disease of the
cultured classes. The action of the nervi erigentes is incomplete
in psychic impotence, and the complete relaxation of the
corpora cavernosa does not take place. Hence a sufficient quantity
of blood can not enter the erectile tissue to exert pressure
on the outgoing veins. The corpora cavernosa become smaller
and harder at the critical moment and do not admit the entrance
of the blood. The diameter of the penis becomes less than that
of the glans. The penis feels cartilaginous, and the skin is
found in transverse folds through the contraction of the corpora
cavernosa. Hence erections are feeble or entirely wanting
at the critical moment. When the patient is lying in bed alone
he has, in distinction from atonic impotence, quite vigorous
erections.</p>

<p>Psychic impotence is transitorily found also in healthy individuals
when they are in a state of agitation. The more
agitated the patient is, the more the penis shrinks. In psychic
impotence, if the wife is of an exceedingly passionate disposition,
she will make advances and may often evoke powerful
erections, whereas the wife’s indifference would cause impotence.</p>

<p>In this way this form of impotence is often only relative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
With one woman the inability injungendi is complete, while the
virile power is exuberant in concarnatione with another. As a
rule, the patient who has reached the critical age of fifty to
sixty, does not succeed in his conjugal duties but is able commisceri
meretricis auxilio. The indifference of the wife who,
as a rule, is about forty to fifty years of age and has
either passed or is very near the climacterium, accounts for
the husband’s impotence in her company. Such men are able to
perform the act only when the woman actively or at least cheerfully
and willingly yields herself. The sullen, supine position
of the frigid wife is not enough to hold a man’s love forever.</p>

<p>Temporary psychic impotence of short duration is sometimes
met with in newly married men through lack of confidence.
When about to be married, the broodings over things to come
overstimulate the inhibitory centres in the brain. As a result,
at the critical moment, the penis gradually shrinks, grows smaller
and moves in a worm-like manner in the course of its
diminution.</p>

<p>The following case may serve as an illustration for such
cases:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. S., 23 years of age, had suffered from gonorrhoea a few years
previously. He has practised stuprum manu moderately at the time of
puberty. Later on he associated cum meretricibus. He always considered
himself healthy. The seminal discharge was somewhat precipitated,
but the patient attributed this phenomenon to his extraordinary
strength and was rather proud of it. When he became engaged to
his present wife he abstained henceforth from illicit relations. Two
days before the consultation the patient married and, upon approaching
his young bride, found that the erection was too weak to transgress the
virginal portals. After his first failure, every repeated attempt caused
the penis to shrink almost half the normal size of the flaccid condition.
The wife’s genitals were perfectly normal. She did not suffer from
vaginism. Therapeutic suggestion and a medicinal tonic (ut aliquid
fiat) removed the anomaly in a few days.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this case the anaphrodisiac of fear after the first failure
was the cause of the impotence.</p>

<p>Psychic impotence is sometimes present for a short time
after long continued abstinence in men who for some reason have
interrupted their regular sexual relations. Young men who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
never had yet any sex relations are never affected by mere abstinence.
Psychic impotence is not seldom found in men with a
certain vocation requiring great mental strain, as literary men,
bookworms, mathematicians, engineers, etc.</p>

<p>Extreme excitement and desire may cause temporary impotence.
The number of stimuli arriving from the brain is too
vast and paralyzes the centre of erection. A violent lover, who
has for a long time repressed his desires, plunges his entire
organism, in the moment of their realization, into a kind of
ecstasy. His soul, i. e., the immaterial part of his being, concentrates
in the object of his desires all his force and vitality.
He appears entirely to forget his organs which ordinarily serve
to transmit his desires. It is hence first necessary for him that
everything be restored to the ordinary channel, that the moral
over-excitation ceases or that it returns at least to the normal
type of simple excitation, before the centre of erection will have
power to exercise its function.</p>

<p>Want of responsiveness from the mate has sometimes a disadvantageous
effect upon the man. Hence obstacles, on the side
of the woman, will not seldom cause psychic impotence. The
history of the following case is characteristic of this kind of
disturbances:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young medical student made the acquaintance of a young girl
who had previously given birth to a child. The girl did not want to
reveal her secret to her lover, and fearing that, as a medical student,
he might discover her secret in initu, she refused to grant him
her favor. One evening while alone with her in his room, he tried
hard to accomplish his desire by persuasion, caresses, and other means.
When just at the point to break her resistance, the erection suddenly
ceased, and the penis shrunk to half its normal size. From this moment
he suffered from complete impotence. Even nocturnal erections did
not take place any longer. The impotence resisted every kind of treatment,
until, one day, the girl wrote the patient that she was now willing
to yield to his desires. At the first meeting following the letter, puella
tentavit actively to arouse his passion, and he succeeded in having a
powerful erection actionis peragendo. From this moment he was cured
from his ailment and enjoyed his full virile power of former days.</p></blockquote>

<p>This case shows the vast influence the psyche is wielding
even upon the unconscious state of the brain during sleep. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
stimulation of the inhibitory centre was so strong as to prevent
even the occurrence of nocturnal erections.</p>

<p>In illicit relations, the fear of surprise or of infection, shame
or loathing may have inhibitory effects upon the centre of erection
and cause psychic impotence.</p>

<p>Violent shocks to the nervous system, as great fright, pain,
or grief, etc., and all other strong emotions which often affect
the urinary system by causing temporary frequent micturition,
polyuria, or glycosuria, may also give rise to disturbances of the
sexual functions and cause psychic impotence of a transitory
nature.</p>

<p>Over-estimation of the difficulties of defloration sometimes
causes temporary impotence in nervous newly married men.
The timidity of inexperience may in the same way have the
effect of an anaphrodisiac.</p>

<p>Sometimes the exaggerated veneration of his young wife
may cause temporary loss of vigor in the young husband. The
thought that such an exalted personality, as his young innocent
wife, should have to submit to such an indignity (not a few
have this strange opinion of the conjugal act), works as an
inhibition of the proper performance of the act.</p>

<p>The most frequent cause of psychic impotence is the thought
of failure. An accidental single failure through the temporary
abuse of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, or tea or through intense desire
may occur, some day, which in the healthy man would pass
unnoticed. But the nervous man will begin to brood over this
failure, and this brooding will prevent the formation of associative
paths in the brain at every subsequent attempt of coition.
In nervous men, the imagination, having once become impressed
with groundless fears, may retain them with extreme tenacity
and busy itself with constant brooding in solitude over the fancied
ills. Thus a disorder of adjustment is established, and a
psychic trauma is created, through the subconscious effects of
cryptogrammic nerve-currents. This psychic trauma is translated
into fear again. The subconscious cerebral processes lead
to the formation of ideas, later recallable in memory. These
morbid ideas become the substratum of future anxiety-attacks.
A pathological state is thus induced where the natural course of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
erection fails to follow the sexual excitement. In this way a
veritable disease is produced, where there is a strong desire without
full power. Every additional failure provokes more intense
broodings which are naturally again the cause of failure. Thus
a vicious circle is created which may render an occasional innocent
failure a permanent impotency.</p>

<p><i>Atonic impotence.</i>—The most frequent form of impotence
of copulation, in fact, the impotence “par excellence,” is the
atonic impotence. This is the impotency which is generally
caused by venereal excesses, either in copulation, masturbation,
mental erethism, frustrate eroticism, or last but not least, conjugal
onanism or coitus interruptus. These excesses cause the
exhaustion of the centre of erection, irritation of the centre of
ejaculation and a debilitation and enervation of the genital
nerves. For when the lumbar centre of erection fails to respond,
there is a deficiency in activity, excitability, mobility, and tonicity
of the entire genital apparatus.</p>

<p>In the atonic form of impotence conditions of absolute
impotency are quite rare. Absolute impotence is mostly found
in the paralytic form which is caused by cerebrospinal and nervous
diseases. In the atonic anomaly the vast majority of cases
are of partial impotence.</p>

<p>The impotence due to weakness is distinguished by premature
ejaculation and the subsequent immediate subsidence of
erection. Sometimes a vigorous erection ceases suddenly before
emission has occurred, and the penis becomes completely flaccid
and shrivels to half its normal size before the entrance into the
vagina. When ejaculation does later occur it takes place without
erection or pleasurable sensations. Not seldom the entrance
into the vagina is effected with good erection, but when about
to begin the act, the penis suddenly wilts, the wilting either followed
by ejaculation or not. The following case illustrates the
ordinary symptoms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. L., 45 years of age, happily married, and father of several
children, was always healthy and strong and had never had gonorrhoea
or syphilis, but had freely masturbated when he was young. He always
considered himself a powerful man. He is given to athletics, horseback
riding, ball playing, swimming, rowing, etc. For the last year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
the patient noticed a certain weakness in his potency. As soon as he
enters the vagina, ejaculation takes place at once and is followed by
immediate flaccidity of the penis. Sometimes, while trying intromission,
the erection ceases like a shot ante portas. When he does not
try congressus the erection lasts much longer. The patient’s wife has
been of a rather frigid nature, never asking or caring for concarnatio.
But recently she seems at times to have rather a certain longing for the
embrace. This fact makes the patient feel doubly miserable, not to
succeed, when the partner seems to desire and enjoy the initus.</p></blockquote>

<p>This case is one of those where objectively there is very little
to discover. In some cases of atonic impotence the patients
show neurasthenic or cerebrasthenic symptoms. The underlying
cause of the impotence, as a rule, determines the symptom-complex
of the case. If the cause of the impotence is excess in
masturbation, the case will show all the symptoms of the typical
masturbator. The latter is generally small, emaciated, hollow-chested,
thin-necked and weak-kneed. He shows deep-set eyes
and pale hollow cheeks. The penis and testicles are small. The
penis is cold and shriveled. The patient has a bad taste in his
mouth, and suffers from winds in his stomach. He also suffers
from obstinate constipation and colicky pains in the bowels. He
complains of palpitation of the heart, shortness of breath and
of a burning sensation in his arms. He suffers from loss of
memory and from tinnitus aurium. The patient also shows a
certain moral abasement, incontrollable restlessness, carelessness
in dress and person and shambling in gait. The history of the
following case is that of a typical masturbator:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. C. is 31 years of age and unmarried. At the time of puberty,
when he was 14 years old, he began to practise stuprum manu. Se
stuprabat manu three to four times daily. When twenty years of
age he began to associate cum meretricibus. But the natural initus
did not seem to satisfy him. Post omnem initum manu se stuprabat,
in addition, as soon as he reached his residence. Three years ago
he contracted gonorrhoea, from which he suffered a whole year. Since
a year he noticed a certain weakness in his potency. He is able to effect
intromission, but before he can begin the act, ejaculation without the
least trace of libido takes place, followed by immediate flaccidity of the
penis. He has some erections in the morning but they are not complete
as in former times.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the cause of the atonic impotence was venereal ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>cesses
or gonorrhoeal prostatitis, the long-kept-up congestion of
the prostatic urethra and of the colliculus leads to general reflex
excitability, to a high degree of nervousness, cerebrasthenia, and
neurasthenia. The colliculus being an organ which finds its
analogue in the female uterus, its constant irritation will show
phenomena in men, usually found in intensely hysterical women
only.</p>

<p>The impotent men generally change their entire psychic
nature. They become timid, morose, solitary, melancholic, hypochondrical
and despondent. They are discontented, peevish, ill-humored,
and evince either blunted or inordinate sexual desires.
They show profound agitation at the slightest excitement. The
patients are troubled with insomnia or unrefreshed sleep and
with a feeling of heaviness on rising. The mind is enfeebled
and the memory impaired. The mental debility and dulness
cause inability to collect their thoughts and thus enfeebles the
mind in its power of concentration. The patients suffer from
vertigo, singing in the ears, from a feeling of fulness in the
head, from asthenopia, depression, anxiety and irritability. They
often suffer from palpitation of the heart, sick headaches, coldness
of the hands and feet, dull heavy feelings, a sense of
fatigue and a loss of flesh. They also complain of creeping sensations
in the loins, of pricking in the back, of twitching and
jerking of the muscles, of muscular weakness, of lumbar pain
and asthma. The intestinal canal shows a general derangement,
as coated tongue, poor appetite, sense of weight in the epigastrium
after eating, flatulence, sluggishness of the bowels and
constipation. The general health of the patient is broken, the
countenance is vacant and the gait feeble.</p>

<p>Besides the general symptoms, the genito-urinary organs
are especially affected in atonic impotence. The external genitals
show a certain flaccidity, shrinkage, paleness of the mucous
membranes and a diminution of the sensibility and electrical
irritability. The skin of the penis is cold, shriveled and somewhat
insensible to electrical stimulation. The electrical irritability
of the skin of the two halves of the scrotum is of a different
degree, the right half being sometimes more sensitive than
the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>The testicles are often very painful and tightly drawn up
against the external abdominal rings. The spermatic cord often
shows an enlargement of the veins (varicocele). The vas deferens
and the ampulla are in a state of inflammation.</p>

<p>The seminal vesicles are plainly felt indurated, nodular and
distended with fluid. In a large proportion of cases the repeated
congestion causes a veritable seminal vesiculitis. This inflammation
is not seldom extended to the ejaculatory ducts and occludes
the same. Through this occlusion spermatic colic, i. e.,
a severe pain in the region of the vesicles, often seizes the patient,
especially after some sexual excitement, as dancing, caressing,
and even flirting. After such excitement a dull pain in
the region of the prostate and in the perineum as well as in
the testicles, spermatic cords and in the rectum is very annoying
to the patient. Ejaculation often removes these pains. For
that reason the patient tries to relieve himself from the painful
sensations by masturbation. Ejaculation also removes the irritations
of the thighs, hips, anus, hypogastric region and in the
smalls of the back.</p>

<p>The entire urethra is often in a state of hyperaesthesia and
paraesthesia, and the prostatic portion shows congestion and not
seldom an inflammation of the mucous membrane. Especially
the colliculus is often in a severe inflammatory condition. There
is thickening sponginess or puffiness of the parts immediately
involving the ejaculatory ducts. The urethra manifests great
sensibility. The introduction of a bougie produces unbearable
pains. The withdrawal of the sound is often followed by several
drops of blood. This hypertrophy and inflammation of the
colliculus seminalis is the cause of the ejaculatio praecox in the
beginning of the disease. Later on the condition provokes weak
erections and finally ejaculation with flaccid member before
entrance into the vagina.</p>

<p>The irritation of the urethra causes hypersecretion of the
glands of Littré and Cowper which is manifested by the so-called
urethrorrhoea. In urethrorrhoea the secretion is thin, transparent,
perfectly clear and sticky. The secretion has no spermatic
odor and does not stain the linen, but stiffens it. It is
seen as a drop in the morning at awakening with an erection.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
The drop is sticky and tenacious. The meatus urethrae sticks
together. The drop is not rarely found in healthy men after
violent and continuous erections. The secretions show under
the microscope nothing beyond free mucous and columnar and
pavement epithelia.</p>

<p>Besides the hypersecretion of the urethral glands, there is
also a hypersecretion of the prostate, especially in patients who
have indulged in excesses in masturbation and in onanism (coitus
interruptus). Masturbation as well as onanism do not give the
same satisfaction as normal coition, hence constant hankering
for more and overindulgence. Prostatorrhoea is often found
after gonorrhoea, when the yellowish drop gradually becomes
whitish, flocculent, and finally a colorless watery drop of clear,
slightly viscid fluid. It is best seen when the lips of the meatus
are held apart.</p>

<p>In prostatorrhoea the discharge is never milky, white or
purulent as in pure prostatitis. Microscopically the slowly dried
slide shows the characteristic crystals of sodium chloride, but
no spermatozoa. In prostatorrhoea the orifice of the urethra
shows constant moisture. The copious evacuations occur while
straining in the water-closet. The patients are, as a rule, constipated.
The discharge is attended with peculiar sensations,
sometimes of a pleasurable nature, sometimes of a dropping
sensation, weight in the region of the prostate, anus and rectum.
Examination per rectum often shows hard points and nodules
in the prostatic gland.</p>

<p>The most frequent anomaly caused by venereal excesses is
spermatorrhoea and nocturnal pollutions. The excesses provoke
a chronic hypertrophy of the prostatic gland, and this hypertrophy
renders the ejaculatory ducts insufficient.</p>

<p>In spermatorrhoea there is an oozing of semen from the
urethra without erection or pleasurable sensations. The rhythmic
muscular contractions, found in normal ejaculations, are missing
here. The failure of the normal contractions is due to a paresis
of the muscular fibres of the ejaculatory ducts.</p>

<p>Spermatorrhoea usually takes place after micturition or
during defecation. Sometimes spermatorrhoea is caused by the
slightest excitement. The sight of a woman’s bust or of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
leg, the touch of her hand, the smell of her perfume, the glance
at a lascivious painting, or a voluptuous thought may cause a
precipitate discharge, without an erection or with an imperfect
erection. The discharge taking place at a complete relaxation of
the ejaculatory ducts, the voluptuous sensations are, as a rule,
entirely absent.</p>

<p>Spermatic discharges sometimes occur in affections of the
central nervous system, where the usual inhibitions through consciousness
are ineffectual.</p>

<p>Microscopically the discharge in spermatorrhoea shows amyloid
bodies, lecithin and prostatic epithelia. The fluid has the
seminal odor which is peculiar to the spermin reaction; the
amount of spermatozoa is somewhat diminished.</p>

<p>The testicles and the skin of patients, suffering from spermatorrhoea,
are less sensitive to electrical stimulation, while the
urethra is hypersensitive.</p>

<p>Nocturnal emissions constitute the other anomaly of ejaculation.
Physiologically all healthy continent men between the
ages of fifteen to fifty, with very few exceptions, have nocturnal
emissions at intervals of about four weeks (male menstruation).
The pollutions arise during sleep and are accompanied by erotic
dreams and erections. They usually awaken the sleeper. Normal
pollutions occur only in sleep and are accompanied by vigorous
erections, erotic dreams and orgasm. They also cause a sensation
of relief. When pollutions are frequent, two or three times
a week, they become pathological. They are then followed by
lassitude, dizziness, faintness, dragging pains in the occipital
region, mental depression, disinclination for mental effort, sense
of fatigue, lessening of physical strength, pain in the back and
reflex irritability. The patients are startled at the least noise.
They change color every moment. The eyeballs run unsteadily.
There is often found a disturbance of speech, difficulty in breathing,
and palpitation of the heart.</p>

<p>The following case will best illustrate the symptoms in nocturnal
pollutions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. A., 25 years of age, was always well and never had gonorrhoea
or syphilis. When a boy he practised stuprum manu in a moderate
degree, as he says. A few years ago he noticed a certain weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>ness
in erection. The emission took place soon after the entrance into
the vagina and was followed by the immediate flaccidity of the penis.
Sometimes the ejaculation occurred ante portas. The patient, therefore,
gave up trying intercourse. Since then he is suffering from nocturnal
pollutions, which occur every night or at least three to four times a
week. The following day the patient feels very weak, as to prevent him
from performing his usual work in his trade. He suffers from headaches
and pains in the lumbar region and in the legs. He is engaged
to be married and is looking forward with great apprehension to the
approaching time of this momentous event.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pathological pollutions are caused by a paralysis of the
circular muscular fibres of the ejaculatory ducts. This paralysis
may be either of a purely nervous nature or caused through inflammatory
processes. Atony of the mouths of the ejaculatory
ducts not seldom produces nocturnal pollutions. Sometimes pollutions
are also due to a spasm of the detrusors of the seminal
vesicles.</p>

<p>When the seminal vesicles and the ejaculatory ducts are
thus affected, very little is needed to cause a nocturnal emission.
Any diurnal excitement will be followed by nocturnal erotic
images and pollutions. Sleeping on the back, by causing a fluction
of blood to the spinal cord, will also produce pollutions.</p>

<p>Besides the genitals, the urinary system is also greatly affected
in atonic impotence. The hyperaesthesia and hyperaemia
of the prostatic urethra and of the colliculus, usually found in
atonic impotence, are the cause of a continual irritation of the
bladder.</p>

<p>The irritation of the neck of the bladder provokes a spasm
of the detrusor vesicae. To this spasm is due the frequent painless
impulse to urinate, by day when under mental activity, and
in sleepless nights.</p>

<p>Sometimes the detrusor is in a paretic condition. In paresis
of the bladder the patient has to wait for the urine to come
and has to use abdominal pressure to effect urination. The
urine falls without force perpendicularly from the urethra.
There is often desire to urinate, but never a feeling of satisfaction
after urinating. When catheterization is attempted, there
is a powerful resistance at the neck of the bladder, through a
certain spasm of the sphincter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<p>In spasm of the sphincter of the bladder there is also frequent
impulse to urinate. Not seldom such patients are unable
to urinate in the presence of others. Sometimes the urine cannot
be passed at all. The spasm of the sphincter creates a certain
difficulty in starting the act of micturition. The stream is
often interrupted and, at the end, a dribbling of urine takes
place. Through the spasmodic contraction of the muscular
fibres of the sphincter the urethra represents a rigid open tube
in which one end is closed; it thus resembles a pipette which
retains the fluid as long as one end is closed. When the relaxation
takes place, the fluid contained in the urethral tube dribbles
out of the meatus.</p>

<p>In paralysis or paresis of the sphincter the patient urinates
often but in small quantities. In paresis of the sphincter there
is no resistance to catheterization at the neck of the bladder.
In the beginning of the paresis there is incontinence of urine
during the night. Later on when the disease has progressed,
and a perfect paralysis has ensued, the incontinence of the urine
is constant even in daytime.</p>

<p>In enuresis nocturna, often found in masturbating children,
there is an imperfect innervation of the sphincter, while the
innervation of the detrusor of the bladder is perfect.</p>

<p>In all these anomalies the urethra is very sensitive. The
passage of an instrument causes unbearable anguish. The patient
acts as mad when the sound is introduced. There is often
found a troublesome burning in the urethra, especially in the
fossa navicularis, during or after micturition.</p>

<p>Besides the frequent urgency to urination, in all these
troubles, there is not seldom an actual polyuria present. The
urine is pale, clear, watery, with low specific gravity, often as
low as 1002. The urine is not seldom loaded with phosphates.
Sometimes oxaluria, with high specific gravities up to 1050, is
discovered. Transient glycosuria as high as two to three per
cent. is also found. At times vesical tenesmus is met with.
Sometimes anuria is observed, although the kidneys are in perfect
order.</p>

<p><i>The pathology of female impotence.</i>—The same four kinds
of impotencies found in men are also met with in women, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
the only difference that the frequency of one or the other of
the impotencies is different in the different sexes. They are:
1) impotence of voluptas, 2) impotence of copulation, 3) impotence
of reproduction, and 4) impotence of libido.</p>

<p><i>Impotence of voluptas.</i>—The entire absence of the sense of
sex, or impotence of voluptas, where the individual has absolutely
no sexual inclination to any individual of the other sex, is more
frequently met with in women than in men. Still even in
women this idiopathic frigidity, this insensibility where the
woman is completely frigid by temperament, is much rarer than
is generally believed. In fact, it is extremely difficult to find a
woman who is without aptitude of sexual emotion.</p>

<p>Physiological frigidity exists in infants and in very old age.
After a regular and satisfactory orgasm the woman is physiologically
more or less anaesthetic for some time. The ablation of
both ovaries before puberty causes total anaesthesia, while the
operation after puberty produces, for a certain time, at least,
only an impairment of libido, or orgasmus retardatus. Congenital
degeneration of the ovarian glands will be accompanied
by total absence of the sense of sex. As in men, the total absence
of sexual desire is found in severe cases of neurasthenia,
where the entire nervous system is in a low state of efficiency.
Idiopathic impotence of voluptas is further found in low idiots
and in dementia, where there is lack of understanding of the
opposite sex. The sexual perversity of homosexuality, as a
rule, causes total impotence of sexual desire for the opposite
sex. Sometimes the cause for the anaesthesia lies in the centre,
otherwise the patient is perfectly normal, as in the following
case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, forty years of age, twenty years married, is a highly
cultured lady. She never had a child or was pregnant while living
with her two first husbands. A prominent gynaecologist, who had
examined her several years previously, attributed the cause of her
sterility to an infantile uterus. She has never, in her life, experienced
any sexual desire and seems to be proud of it. She attributes this lack
of passion to her great mental activity. An examination revealed a
pregnancy of about four months.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Impotence of copulation</i>, except in the anomaly known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
vaginism, is very rarely found in women. Conjugation is, of
course, impossible in the rare cases of total absence of the vagina.
In hypospadia, where the vaginal orifice is situated within the
rectum, vaginal conjugation is well-nigh impossible. Adhesions
of the labia majora or minora, a rigid imperforated hymen, an
extreme vaginal atresia near the orifice and elephantiasis of the
vulva will cause impotence of conjugation. All acute inflammations
of the vulva, vagina, rectum, uterus tubes, or ovaries may
render approach painful and impossible. Urethral caruncles,
urethritis, fissures at the neck of the bladder, rectal fissures or
hemorrhoids may also render conjugation difficult. The tetanic
contraction of the sphincter cunni and the tetanic spasm of
the perineal muscles, constrictor cunni, transversus perinei,
sphincter and levator ani which close tightly the orifices of
the vagina and the entire vaginal canal will also be the cause
of impotentia coeundi. The solitary tetanic contraction of the
sphincter cunni, known under the name of vaginism, will make
conjugation impossible until the hymen is removed. The following
case operated by the author illustrates this anomaly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. X., twenty-two years of age, for three months married to a
physician, was unable to be approached by her husband. As soon as
the penis touched the labia, the sphincter cunni contracted so tightly
that there was an utter impossibility to transverse the virginal portals.
During the examination, at the least touch of the nymphae, the
sphincter could be observed contracting, just as seen in animals after
defecation when the sphincter ani contracts. The ablation of the hymen
cured the anomaly. This fact shows that it was only a reflex-irritation,
started at the highly sensitive hymen. The sphincter itself was perfectly
normal.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Impotence of reproduction.</i>—More frequent than impotence
of copulation is female impotence of reproduction. This anomaly
is naturally found in all those cases where there is impotence
of copulation. It is sometimes met with in excessive acid reaction
of the vaginal contents, where the spermatozoa are killed
before they reach the uterus.</p>

<p>When one lip of the cervix is considerably elongated, covering
apron-like the external os, the spermatozoa will not be able
to enter the cervix, and sterility will result. Sterility is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
found in the obliteration of the cervical canal, produced by
caustics or scars after tears during confinements and after curettings.
Ectropion, stenosis of the external or internal os of the
cervical canal, endocervicitis, causing an increased cervical secretion,
and the swelling of the plicae palmatae may prevent the
entrance of semen into the uterus and thus cause impotence of
propagation.</p>

<p>The anomalies of the uterus are also sometimes responsible
for sterility. Uterus foetalis and obliterations of the lumen of
the uterus will result in absolute sterility. Uterus infantilis,
hypoplasia of the uterus, atresia of the uterus or polypi, hypertrophic
chronic metritis, degeneration of the uterus or uterine
deviations may often be the cause of sterility.</p>

<p>The anomalies of the tubes which cause sterility are absence
of the tubes, rudimentary tubes, total or even partial obliteration
of their lumen, as in salpingitis nodosa, closing of the ends of
the tubes in bilateral salpingitis, and adherences of the tubes
to the neighboring parts, as found in pelviperitonitis, perimetritis,
perisalpingitis, and perioöphoritis.</p>

<p>The anomalies of the ovaries, causing impotence of procreation,
are absence of the ovaries, hypoplasia of the parenchymatous
tissue of the ovaries, fibrous degeneration of the ovaries, alteration
of their position, as extreme prolapsus and hernia of the
ovaries.</p>

<p>All these anomalies may produce either absolute or relative
sterility. In regard to frequency they are of slight significance
in comparison with endometritis and pelviperitonitis after gonorrhoea.
The gonorrheic infection is, therefore, the cause par
excellence of the impotence of procreation in women as in men.</p>

<p><i>Impotence of libido.</i>—While in men the common form of
impotence is inability of conjugation, the common form of impotence
in women is failure to experience the orgasm, or the
impotence of libido. In this anomaly two grades may be distinguished,
total anaesthesia and partial anaesthesia or orgasmus
retardatus.</p>

<p>In absolute anaesthesia there is not even a vestige of a
libidinous sensation during intercourse. The woman likes caressing,
hugging, kissing, etc., because the potency of voluptas is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
intact. But there is no vestige even of the fore-pleasure, or the
ant-orgastic libido. The woman is devoid of sexual sensation,
her genitals have no more excitability for pleasurable sensations
than her fingers. Hence no desire for coition exists. On the
contrary, there is, as a rule, a pronounced disinclination to the
act. Where there is complete absence of pleasurable feelings,
the act becomes naturally loathsome to the individual. If coition
is granted it is done either from a sense of duty or for gain.</p>

<p>Physiological anaesthesia exists in children until puberty,
and in adults in old age. Even after menstruation has set in,
the girl is, as a rule, anaesthetic in regard to libido, although
she may be erotic. “The girl has to be kissed into a woman.”
After the climacterium the woman generally becomes again
more or less anaesthetic. Some women may continue to experience
libido years after this period, and may manifest symptoms
of great sexual excitement as seen in the following case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. X., married to an elderly man, looked upon the marital
relations more as a duty than as a pleasure during her entire married
life. But since the climacterium has set in, the rare approaches of her
husband are impatiently awaited and they cause her great sexual excitement
and satisfaction, never experienced before during the entire
period of her active sexual life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such cases are extremely rare. Generally there is a close
connection between the activity of the generative glands and
the degree of libido.</p>

<p>After a regular and satisfactory coition the woman is,
physiologically, more or less anaesthetic for some time. The
length of the neutral period varies in different individuals. Intense
mental activity, emotional depression and long sexual continence
also diminish the sensual pleasure.</p>

<p>Apart from this temporary anaesthesia, there are many
women who are impotent to experience libido throughout their
lives. There is a total absence of pleasurable feelings during
coition or any other kind of sexual stimulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young lady, twenty-two years of age, complains that while
during the time of her engagement she greatly enjoyed her fiancé’s
caresses and became sexually excited when fondled by him, since her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>marriage she is unable to experience any libido in coition, although
her husband is possessed of great potency. The patient is a beautiful
brunette, with fiery eyes, and is a picture of health. Examination
shows a uterus infantilis.</p></blockquote>

<p>The potency of voluptas in this case is wholly intact. The
patient enjoys being fondled and caressed. The cause of the
impotency of libido lies in the periphery, although uterus infantilis
is seldom accompanied by impotence of libido.</p>

<p>In some cases the woman is normally developed in every
respect, menstruates regularly and is frequently quite prolific.
The power of procreation is sometimes even very great. The
woman is generally quite erotic and falls in love easily. Yet she
never experiences the least libido.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young lady, twenty-eight years of age, mother of two healthy
children, was sent by her family physician from Chicago to consult the
author for her impotence of libido. The husband stated that he is
sure of his wife’s attachment to him. She enjoys his company and likes
to be caressed by him. Still during the eight years of their married
life she never showed the least sign of libido at coition. She remains
cold and indifferent, and only submits conjugationi to please
her husband. The examination showed the genitals to be in perfect
order.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the following case, too, no cause whatsoever could be
found for the anaesthesia in regard to libido.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. L., twenty-nine years of age, is seven months married. Her
menstruation set in when she was fifteen years of age and was always
regular of about six days’ duration. At that time she began to satisfy
herself by manusturpation and found some libido in the manipulation.
But soon she read in a book about the ill effects of this practice
and stopped it.</p>

<p>In the beginning of her married life coitus caused her great pain,
which diminished by degrees after a few weeks. At present, coition
causes her only disgust. The day after she feels tired and weak.</p>

<p>The examination shows a feminine habitus, breasts well developed,
clitoris normal. The hymenal rests are very sensitive to the touch.
The painful sensation and the feeling of disgust increase when the
anterior vaginal wall is touched. The uterus is enlarged to the size of
a goose-egg, the cervix is soft, and the external os narrowly closed.
Diagnosis, two months’ pregnancy.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>In this case some traces of libido were present at the time
of puberty, which later on entirely disappeared. In some cases
the patient is very prolific, as the following history shows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The author recently performed a perineorrhaphy on an otherwise
healthy woman, mother of five children, who confided in him that she
has never experienced the slightest libido in intercourse. Yet, she
added, if her husband would not take precautions, she would give birth
to a child every year, as was the case in the beginning of their married
life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anaesthesia in women is, as a rule, due to inexcitability of
the genital nerves and to lack of excitation at the centre of
libido. Sometimes anatomical anomalies of the genitals may
cause impotence of libido. The integrity and the free exercise
of the generative organs are necessary for the integrity of the
libidinous feeling, although sexual pleasure is experienced at
the nervous centres, and the generative organs play only a
secondary part. The vaginal bulbi and their muscle, the constrictor
cunni, the intermediary net of veins between the bulbs
and the clitoris, and the free part of the latter, the glans of the
clitoris, must functionate normally in order to give full satisfaction
in intercourse.</p>

<p>Hence diminution or extinction of the sense of libido will
be caused by castration, degeneration of the ovarian glands,
marasmus, sexual excesses and overindulgence in alcoholic beverages
or cocaine.</p>

<p>In the following case the erotic feeling increased in such
a degree after the castration, probably through the extinction of
the libido, as to deceive the family physician and lead him to
make the diagnosis nymphomania.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Miss X., a school teacher, over thirty years of age, was always
chaste and indifferent not only to any carnal pleasure, but also to male
company. On account of a uterine fibroid, a total extirpation of uterus
and ovaries was performed. Since the operation the patient complains
of great sexual excitability she had never experienced before the operation.
She is so excited sexually that she is possessed of the almost
imperative impulse to kiss every male person she meets on the street, and
but for her position, she would have long ago yielded to this impulsive
desire.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<p>In another case of diminution of the potency of libido, only
uterine inflammation and pregnancy could be discovered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. M., thirty-five years of age, four months married, had always
suffered pain in the back during menstruation. The patient complains
that she only experienced libido twice since she has been married.
Since the last experience in the first weeks of her married life, she
has no pleasure at all. Coition, though not painful, causes her a disagreeable
feeling. An examination revealed anteflexio uteri, enlargement
and catarrh of the cervix, erosions and a three months’ pregnancy.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the following case castration caused inability to experience
libido.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. M., thirty-five years of age, for the last fifteen years married
but sterile. When she was only two years married she began to suffer
from attacks of headaches and vomiting, which repeated almost every
other day. Her menstruation was regular. After having tried all the
stomach specialists in the city without finding any relief from the
vomiting spells, she consulted a gynaecologist, and he promptly found
an ovary to be the cause of all her troubles. She had been previously
operated upon for gall stones, which were not found and for appendicitis,
when the presumably diseased appendix was removed. She now
submitted to ovariectomy on the left side. Three months after the
operation the vomiting spells returned, and she submitted again to a
removal of the right ovary. But even this double castration did not
relieve her. When she first consulted the author she was still suffering
from these spells, especially before menstruation, which is still present
although irregular. The patient declares that previous to the ovariotomies
she experienced full libido and was able to induce orgasm.
After the second ovariotomy this potency was lost. She gets excited
during coition, but the orgasm cannot be produced. The following day
she feels nervous and weak.</p></blockquote>

<p>In another case of impotence of libido nothing else but
anteflexio could be discovered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. H., twenty-four years of age, four years married, was confined
by the author a year ago of a healthy girl. The patient complains
of never having experienced any libido. Before her confinement coition
caused her great pain and misery. Since her confinement she suffers
no more pain during the act, but libido is still absent. She complains
of great dryness of the parts, so that vaseline has to be used to facilitate
walking. At the examination there was found redness of the vulva,
catarrh and erosion of the cervix and anteflexio.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>In the following case of anaesthesia the author could discover
no other cause but general weakness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. W., twenty-six years of age, was always pale and weak.
Menstruation set in at twelve years of age. At nineteen she was
married, and ten months later gave birth to her first child. Four years
later gave birth to another child. For the last year she complains
of stomach trouble and weakness, pain in the back and abdomen.
Menstruation is now four to six days ahead of time and lasts five
days. She never experienced orgasm but twice. Both times the intercourse
was followed by pregnancy. Other times coition only excites
her but never brings full satisfaction. The following day she suffers
from severe headaches. An examination only revealed a catarrh of the
cervix. The patient received a tonic, and the husband was given some
hygienic rules to observe in initu. Five weeks later the husband
informed the author that the anaesthesia had disappeared.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes sexual anaesthesia is the result of a hard confinement
producing lesion of the muscle bulbo-cavernosus or of
the erectile tissue of the bulbs themselves. The blood is then
prevented from leaving the bulbs and from entering the corpora
cavernosa of the clitoris. In this way the erection of the clitoris,
which is more or less necessary for the full and normal inducement
of the orgasm, is rendered impossible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The author recently treated a young lady, twenty years of age.
She had her first menstruation when she was sixteen years old and was
always regular. She had been married eighteen months, and her baby
was eight months old. The patient called to be treated for leucorrhoea,
but her husband called the following day and stated that his wife
has no pleasurable feeling during initus since her confinement. Before
this event, she found perfect gratification. An examination revealed
nothing but a catarrh of the cervix and a slight enlargement of the
left ovary.</p>

<p>Roubaud also relates the confidences of a patient who wished se
stuprare manu a few days after her confinement, but could not, with
all her manipulations, induce the desired orgasm. The normal potency
returned only after a long rest.</p></blockquote>

<p>The number of women afflicted with the anomaly of impotence
of libido is considerable. It is claimed by many authorities
that ten to twenty per cent. of all women are afflicted with
this anomaly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
The symptoms of total anaesthesia are subjective and objective.
There is first the statement of the husband about his
wife’s indifference and coldness during the conjugal embrace.
The woman complains of lack of orgasm and ejaculation and
of the immediate flowing off of the sperma after coition. The
peristaltic contractions of the vaginal walls, beginning at the
vaginal orifice, and the aspirating movements of the uterus, as
they take place in the normal woman, during the orgasm, are
missing here. Hence the sperma is immediately discharged
from the vagina.</p>

<p>One of the most conspicuous objective symptoms is a relaxation
of the entire genital tract. The glans of the clitoris is often
undeveloped or wholly adherent to the prepuce. In some women
old lacerations of the perineum are present. The genital muscles,
the levator ani and constrictor cunni as well as the perineum,
are languid and withered. The mucous membrane of the entire
genital tract is in a state of hypersecretion, as in true chronic
inflammations. The vagina is wide and flabby, the walls are
lacking elasticity. The portio vaginalis uteri is flabby and
pointed. The uterine walls are weak and soft, and the cavity is
wide. The uterus is extremely movable and generally lies in retropositio,
the relaxation of the uterine ligaments allowing it to
fall downward and backward. The patient’s general health is
often poor, she is anemic, nervous and weak. Sometimes there
is only hypoplasia of some of the genital organs, otherwise the
woman enjoys good health.</p>

<p>Women suffering from anaesthesia may without sacrifice
refuse their favors to their husbands and render them submissive
to their will and henpecked. Single women, having no pleasure
in and hence no desire for conjugation, if they are not induced
to give themselves for pecuniary considerations, easily remain
virtuous and seem to be very proud of this enforced purity.
Even among married women there are wives who pride themselves
on repugnance or distaste for their conjugal obligations.
They speak of their coldness and the calmness of their senses
as though they were not defects but great virtues. Yet the sour,
shallow, sexless shrew is surely an imposture as a wife. Her
marriage is nothing else but a fraud.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
In congenital anaesthesia the therapy is valueless, although
electricity by Apostoli’s method and massage may be tried in
uterus infantilis and in undeveloped ovaries. In prolific women
the only advice the physician may give is that, in harmony with
Ovid’s recommendation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Tu quoque cui Veneris sensum natura negavit,</div>
  <div class="verse">“Dulcia mendaci gaudia finge sono.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>for the sake of matrimonial peace, simulation of libido and
orgasm is a justifiable fraud. Even to resort to some lubricant
to simulate the secretion from the Bartholinian and cervical
glands is permissible. The man is easily deceived in this respect.
He does not in any way feel the ejaculation of the woman. He
only surmises her orgasm by her bearing during the culmination
of the libido.<a id="FNanchor_AY_51" href="#Footnote_AY_51" class="fnanchor">AY</a> The woman also does not feel immediately the
male ejaculation, but she perceives it soon by the increase of
moisture. Then the effect naturally increases the excitement,
as the following case shows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young woman of twenty-two, who has practised stuprum manu
from her early childhood, confided to the author that she derived more
libidinem de stupro manu quam de initu. Yet, she added, after some
abstinence from regular initus, although she is fully indulging in her
favorite pastime, she has a veritable sitim seminis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Patients afflicted with congenital impotence of libido are
very seldom seen by the physician. They are not aware of their
anomaly, and being otherwise normal and in full possession of
the power of procreation, they never ask for treatment. The
physician learns of such cases only by chance. It is different
in acquired impotence of libido. Here the patient knows what
she has lost, and the physician is often asked for advice and
for a remedy. Hence the study of this anomaly is very important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
for the physician, although this impotence has not the same importance
in women as it has in men, where it causes impotence
of copulation and destroys the marriage relations of the couple.</p>

<p><i>Orgasmus retardatus.</i>—The other grade in the impotence
of libido is partial anaesthesia, in which the patient is able to
experience the ant-orgastic pleasure, but cannot induce real
orgasm. The intensity of the pleasurable feeling does not reach
the sudden climax and does not diminish abruptly. The climax
is never reached, and the ant-orgastic libido decreases gradually
and slowly, it dies away. In idiopathic partial anaesthesia,
where the anomaly is congenital, the patient has never experienced
an orgasm, and hence is not aware of her anomaly.</p>

<p>It is different in the acquired form of partial anaesthesia
or in the so-called orgasmus retardatus. The sexual excitement
of the woman suffering from orgasmus retardatus is never abated,
her libido is unimpeded, but the potency of experiencing orgasm
is diminished or entirely absent. The following extracts of a
letter from a patient suffering from a certain degree of orgasmus
retardatus well illustrates the complaints of this class of patients:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have been married over a year now, and have never experienced
any satisfaction in initu. The glands seem to secrete the
fluids, and the cupido congressus is there, but no satisfaction. I
am always sleepless and nervous afterwards and sometimes suffer from
headaches the following morning. I am at times bothered with leukorrhoea.
When a child faciebam stuprum manu, but not since my sixteenth
year of age, and I am at present twenty-five years old. I have
never been pregnant.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following case is extremely interesting, because the patient
is able to induce orgasm only in one certain position. In
all other positions she is impotent of experiencing libido. In
March, 1908, the patient consulted the author about her anomaly.
Being a highly educated woman (she was a school teacher before
she married) she was asked to write in a letter the history of
her case, and the following are the contents of her letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am forty-one years of age, eleven years married, have two
children, one ten, the other eight years old. I began to menstruate at
the age of thirteen and was always regular, the menstruation lasting
three to four days. The flow was always scanty.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>As a child I was sad and dreamy. I can recall times when I
would weep, I scarcely knew for what. When I was nearing puberty
coepi me stuprare manu. No one taught me. I could not help it;
I did not know what I did it for (I was reared on a farm).
The method was sitting on a chair and moving to and fro. I must
have continued till I was eighteen or nineteen years old. I stopped it
long before I knew it was wrong, long before I have ever read it in
books. No one told me it was wrong. I was a good girl in the eyes
of every one.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty I went to college. I think the reason I
stopped stuprum manu was that my mind was greatly engrossed in my
studies. True, I often had the desire, but the association with the opposite
sex would lessen it. I was fond of men in a silent way. I
never, even though in their company, was familiar with them.</p>

<p>When twenty-three years of age I met one towards whom I was
changed. I could not keep away from his presence. I remained a virgin
till we married, when I was thirty years of age. I had known him
seven years, but only saw him often, say three or four times a week,
for the last two years. We spent only one or two evenings each week
together. I allowed and deeply enjoyed all caresses, but they were not
of the lewd fashion. I must have been excited sexually, for I would
experience excessive humorem ut in initu.</p>

<p>At the age of forty-one, libidinem capio ex initu, yet experience
no orgasm save in the position “vir infra,” and in this
position very, very little sensation till the orgasm comes. I am fond
of the concarnatio, but aside from the position just mentioned, I have
not the least libido inter initum. It is a pleasure, you know, to give,
but my own libido is wanting in any of these positions. My husband
prefers alios positus to the one in which I have orgasm; præbente
majorem libidinem.</p>

<p>Multum humesco in initu. Quamquam comisceor quot noctibus
præferrem longum quam parvum temporis spatium concarnationi.</p>

<p>I am never ill, no aches or pains. The only premonition I have
of the approach of the menses is a fulness and tenderness of the breasts.
I menstruate very regularly.</p>

<p>Believe me when I say that once only in the seven years I knew
the one I eventually married—I must have been twenty-three and a
half years old, when I had spent hours in his company, with no more
familiarity than a kiss at parting—I was so excited ut pulvillum
premerem usque ad orgasmum. I could not have helped it, no matter
what had occurred. Often I have been excited thus, but I never
before or since did the same.</p>

<p>I never yielded to desire, though gently pressed to do so. Had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
I been urged beyond my power of endurance I cannot tell what I would
have done. Yet I trust my virtue was due to a predominance of will-power
and not a lack of passion.</p>

<p>I cannot say the lapse of years has changed my desires or lessened
what I call my passions. I am affectionate by nature, but I trust
my emotions are more than affection.</p></blockquote>

<p>The patient makes these last remarks because she is unable
to bring in accord her own feelings with the diagnosis frigidity,<a id="FNanchor_AZ_52" href="#Footnote_AZ_52" class="fnanchor">AZ</a>
received from several physicians whom she had consulted. She
herself knows well that she is passionate enough to exclude any
possibility of frigidity. Hers is a typical case of orgasmus retardatus
of a slight degree (for, in the position “vir infra” orgasm
is possible, for in this position coition lasts considerable
longer), due probably to masturbation but mostly to the tactile
eroticism, practised during the seven years of her engagement.</p>

<p>In pronounced orgasmus retardatus the sexual impulse is
very vivid, but the patient can never find the acme of gratification
in coition. It may often require hours concarnationis continuæ
before the orgasm is induced, and sometimes it may never
be experienced. While there is a strong desire and a theoretical
ability to induce the orgasm,—the patients are able to experience
the orgasm in all its intensity by masturbation—in practice it is
seldom or never attained, because the male will always reach the
acme of coition before the woman has arrived at this point. Her
nervous system remains, therefore, excited to the highest pitch
and brought to a state of expectancy which is not realized.</p>

<p>This lack of orgasm may also happen in normal women.
The woman is generally slower to reach the height of the venereal
paroxysm than the man. Ab initio commixtionis, she experiences
a certain degree of libido that is of greater intensity
than that of the man, i. e., the ant-orgastic libido is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
higher value in women than in men. But this libido is not
developed to its utmost extent, the orgasm, as rapidly as it is
with the man. Still in the normal woman normal conditions will
finally ensue after some experience—it is known that in women
lustful feelings are not always brought about by the first contact,—while
the conditions are entirely different in the partially
impotent woman. No one man, except he be a eunuch, is ever
able to satisfy her in a natural way. Her nervous system remains
in a constant state of excitement to the highest degree,
analogous to satyriasis in men. Her active potency appears to
the superficial observer to be increased, it is almost inexhaustible.
The following case will illustrate this point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young lady, twenty-one years of age, for six months pregnant
with her first child, showed at the examination normal internal genital
organs, but small nymphae and an undeveloped clitoris. The patient
coepit stuprum manu facere, tres annos nata, femora commissa fricando
ultro citroque aut pulvillum aut aliam rem inter ea. As far as she can
remember she always felt humorem in genitalibus suis after such manipulations.
She practised stuprum manu several times daily until her marriage.
Her husband left her in the first months of her pregnancy and she
began to indulge in her favorite practices. “In coitione usitata frictiones
continuas poscit”, and can endure them for hours. She claims to have
the feeling of becoming wet several times during the “copulatione longa
et continua,” but the libido does not materially increase cum humorem
sentiat. The intensity of the libido remains always the same.
She is continually uttering endearing words to her mate and is begging
him, ne patiatur ejaculationem cito venire. She remains excited “postquam
frictiones cessaverunt” and is always showing her disappointment
when the penis “retractus est.” After a little while, her excitement
gradually subsides, and the patient falls asleep. When she awakes she
immediately “coitionem iterum poscit.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we have a case of a partially impotent woman whose
anaesthesia and slight development of the clitoris was in all
probability the result of her early practice of masturbation. The
orgasm cannot be induced, but the ant-orgastic state is accompanied
by libido of a considerable degree. The glands furnish
enough secretion to give the feeling of moisture; there is no
real ejaculation as in normal congressus.</p>

<p>While the totally anaesthetic woman has no natural desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
for coition, and in this respect resembles the woman who is
suffering from idiopathic frigidity or impotence of voluptas, the
woman with the power of experiencing libido, but afflicted with
the anomaly of orgasmus retardatus, has an intense desire for
conjugation. She seeks it oftener than the normal woman, for
the reason that her desire is seldom satisfied. She demands,
therefore, commixtionem continuam per horas et pæne quot noctibus.
Such a Messalina is able commisceri centies in una nocte
and yet be unsatisfied. Even if she had it in her power,
like Katherine of Russia, to order cubili suo a whole regiment
of soldiers quot noctibus, she would still remain unsatisfied.
This anomaly, for these reasons, may often be confounded
with the perversion of nymphomania, where a normal orgasm is
induced with every copulation, but where an immediate reawakening
of desires, after normal satisfaction, takes place.
Through the similarity of the symptoms of orgasmus retardatus
and nymphomania great mistakes in treatment have often been
committed. The wisdom of amputating the clitoris in a case of
nymphomania is very questionable, but the advice to amputate
it in a case of impossible or retarded orgasm and permanently
damage the already weakened nerves is a mistake that borders
almost to malpractice. For the amputation of the clitoris will
impede the inducement of the orgasm even to a greater extent
than before. The genital apparatus, which was weakened by
excesses in venere or in narcotics, is now irreparably destroyed
for all time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The case of Barrus shows what clitoridectomy may sometimes do.
The patient, a young woman, stuprum faciebat manu more or less, all her
life, and finally after suffering from several attacks of nymphomania
decided to have the clitoris amputated. The result was not only failure
to relieve the alleged nymphomania, but even an increase in its severity,
causing a shameless and, almost literally, continuous indulgence in the
habit.</p></blockquote>

<p>The cause of orgasmus retardatus is almost always self-abuse,
either in form of masturbation, mental erethism, or tactile
eroticism. The excitability of the clitoris is so increased through
these practices that it refuses to transfer its excitability upon
the internal genital organs for the inducement of orgasm by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
coition. The ant-orgastic pleasure is hence intact or even increased,
but the orgasm is seldom or never provoked.</p>

<p>The unsatisfied intercourse will in the long run cause a
number of nervous troubles which take the form of hysteria or
assume the character of neurasthenia. The unsatisfied initus
repeatedly practised, in not leading to the acme of libido and
to the relief from the congestion by the ejaculation, is the cause
of chronic hyperaemia and stasis. This leads, in its farther
progress, to chronic inflammations of the tissues, which are
known under the respective names of metritis, perimetritis, parametritis,
endometritis, salpingitis and ovaritis. The labia are
tumefied and dry, the meatus urinarius inflamed and the urethra
pouted out. The clitoris is elongated, inflamed and often
abraded. The external genitals are in a state of burning heat.
The vaginal mucous membrane is hard and excoriated, the cervix
is congested and the external orifice inflamed.</p>

<p>Apart from these pathological changes caused by the failure
or the retarding of the orgasm, the anomaly is of grave social
importance. The woman with whom orgasm is impossible generally
repels her husband. Her nerves never being exhausted,
as in the normal woman (it is little known that a woman is more
affected and fatigued by a real orgasm than a man), spatium
congressus may last as long as the vaginal epithelia can
endure it, which means a considerable length of time. This is
mistaken by the husband for increased potency. He believes her
to be more potent than he is, and, in the long run, a man dislikes
a lascivious woman. What he wishes is a modest woman
who never asks for conjugal embrace when he is not disposed
to it, and at times even knows gently and tactfully to refuse her
favors when they are asked. Orgasmus retardatus is hence not
simply a question for the physician; it is a matter of serious
social importance.</p>

<p>The correct treatment for this anomaly is, in the first
place, total abstinence from sexual excitement in any form, and
then strengthening of the nerves by tonics, hydrotherapeutics
and electricity by Apostoli’s method.</p>

<p><i>Orgasmus praecox.</i>—The exact opposite to orgasmus retardatus
is the anomaly of orgasmus praecox. In men, suffering from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
this anomaly where ejaculation occurs before the penis has time
to enter the vagina, the precipitated orgasm has the same effect
as the real impotence of concubitus. In women suffering from
orgasmus praecox, the orgasmus is induced as soon as the mentula
reaches the vestibule.</p>

<p>In some women the excitability of the genital nerves reaches
such a degree that the mere touch of the gynaecologist’s finger
during an examination will immediately induce orgasm. Since
erection ceases in both sexes after the orgasm, this anomaly is
of great importance in men, because the conjugal embrace cannot
be consummated. In women, on the other hand, with their
passive rôle during concarnatio, and with whom erection of the
clitoris is not requisite for sexual congress, the act may be continued
as in the normal woman. The anomaly is hence of less
importance in women. Still it has some bearing upon the
woman’s fecundity. In the ideal commixtione the female orgasm
ought to take place immediately after that of the male, so that
aspiration of some amounts of sperma could be effected. In the
anomaly of orgasmus praecox the spermatozoa have to rely upon
their own power of motion to reach the interior of the uterus.
The anomaly may, therefore, sometimes lead to sterility. Otherwise
medical aid is never sought for. The pathological condition
is extremely rare, anyway.</p>

<p>In the same way the anomaly of a diminished frequency is
of no importance to the physician when occurring in women.
He may be asked for advice when it is met in men, for it may
lead to some incongruities in the matrimonial life of the couple,
especially when the wife is of a sensual nature. But a woman
who is able even very rarely to experience orgasm will never
seek the advice of her physician.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />

<small>HYPERAESTHESIA</small></h3>


<p>Sexual hyperaesthesia signifies an abnormal intensity of
the sexual instinct. The intensity of the impulse of voluptas
varies in different individuals, and the line of demarkation between
the physiological and the pathological increase of the impulse
is not always distinctly pronounced. With some individuals
the intensity may reach a high degree and still be within
the physiological bounds. This is especially the case where the
intensity of experiencing libido is correspondingly increased.
But when there is a conflict between the two potencies, the
potency of voluptas and that of libido, the least exaggeration in
the intensity of voluptas becomes pathological. Such an anomaly
where there is a decrease of the intensity of libido and at the
same time an increase of a higher or lesser degree in the intensity
of voluptas, is the phenomenon of mixoscopy. Mixoscopy
thus stands upon the border-land of anaesthesia and hyperaesthesia.</p>

<p><i>Mixoscopy.</i>—Literally, mixoscopy means assisting or rather
looking at animals or at persons while they are in concarnatione.
In this degree the anomaly is a very rare occurrence.
In a broader sense, however, mixoscopy means every active interest
in the erotic relations of others in so far as this interest
bears an erotic character. In this broader sense, mixoscopy is a
widely spread anomaly.</p>

<p>The mixoscopic complex or the system of connected ideas,
having a strong emotional tone and displaying a tendency to
produce or influence thought or action in a definite direction, is
more or less present in every person, especially in its youth.
All the world loves the lover, when the world is allowed to assist
at the scene of the love-making and partake of the erotic delights
of the lover. When the lover is alone, nobody notices him. This
love to assist at erotic scenes is based upon the desire of pro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>curing
for oneself sensual gratification in an indirect way, by
the aid of a third party, with whom one identifies himself and
in whom one submerges his ego so as to experience this person’s
emotions.</p>

<p>The erotic scenes may not be of the gross and the vulgar
variety. Every desire to assist physically or mentally at scenes
with an erotic coloring, even of the most refined, airy and
ethereal nature has a mixoscopic foundation. Mixoscopy is responsible
for the avidity of youth to devour novels and to assist
at plays which generally revolve upon erotic plots. Especially
the desire of those readers who are so impatient as to read the
last chapter first to see if it ends in marriage, is only the refined
way of satisfying the craving for mixoscopy. The gratification
is secured by the reader’s identification of himself or herself with
the hero or heroine. It is often self-deception of many a youth
or maiden when they are petting themselves and boasting of
their love of belles-lettres, as though all their reading is done
in the interest of education and culture. The reader deceives
himself and unconsciously changes the egotistic desire into the
refined longing for mental improvement, rationalization.</p>

<p>Thus in a slight degree mixoscopy is a normal phenomenon.
It is especially found in women, in their eagerness and talent
for match-making. In the interest of others, woman is allowed
to display the activity for sensual gratification which modesty
denies her to develop in her own interest.</p>

<p>Mixoscopy becomes pathological when it degenerates into
panderism or bawdry for the sole purpose of sensual gratification.
The main motives of catering for the lust of others, by
aiding and patronizing an existent love-affair or by calling such
an affair into being, says Meller (O. Sexual Probleme, 1912, p.
480), are of three different kinds. There is 1) the pecuniary
motive or the motive of avarice, found in the professional matchmaker
and in the procurer; 2) there is the motive of toadyism,
the sycophant will descend so low in his degradation even to the
point of becoming the pander or bawd of his or her superior;
3) the erotic motive, when the pander or bawd acts out of love of
the subject. The first two motives are more or less to be counted
among the vices, the third motive has a pathological basis. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
an erotic interest is at play only, the activity of the pander or
bawd becomes pathological in nature. It is found in persons
who through old age, disease, ugliness, poverty, shyness, etc.,
cannot themselves share in the enjoyments of love and who, by
assisting at the gratification of lust by others, try to procure
themselves an opportunity of experiencing a certain part of the
pleasure by identifying themselves with or entering into the spirit
of those whom they aided to the lust.</p>

<p>The emotions connected with mixoscopy or the bawdry
complex is oftener found in women than in men. There are
even mothers who aid and favor the love-affairs of their daughters,
where no material advantage could in any way accrue to
themselves or to their daughters, simply out of lust which they
expect to experience when being present at or thinking of the
erotic incidents between their children and their lovers. The
following history well illustrates this point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. O., forty-five years of age, married for the last twenty-five
years, never had a child. She was operated upon a few years after
she was married, and uterus and ovaries were removed at that operation.
Twenty years after her castration, when the impotence of libido
must have been complete, a nephew of hers, nineteen years old, came
to live with his aunt and uncle. The aunt soon induced the mere
boy to engage himself with a young lady of twenty-three years of age.
Although the aunt well knew that certain legal obstacles prevented the
boy from marrying the young lady, still, in order to enjoy the love-making
of the young people, she did not rest until she effected the engagement.
When the young fiancée left for the West where she was to
stay for a considerable length of time, the aunt induced the boy to
dissolve the engagement and procured him another young lady with
whom he again had to become engaged. When the nephew left for a
foreign country where he was to stay several years, the castrated aunt
had no use any longer for the second fiancée either, began to quarrel
with her and finally forbade her to enter her house.</p></blockquote>

<p>These actions plainly show that her interest in the young
people was founded upon the selfish longing to participate in
their pleasure at the lovers’ dalliance, caressing, kissing, etc.,
which, as an old castrate, she could not experience any longer.
Hers was, therefore, the kind of bawdry from love of the subject.
It was the only way this voluptuous woman—but impotent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
of experiencing libido—could yet partake of any sexual pleasure
by identifying herself with the female lovers of her young
nephew. She had no other advantage to gain by her match-making.</p>

<p>Panderism or bawdry presumes a complete absence of jealousy
of any kind. Patients, suffering from this anomaly, love
to assist at erotic scenes, enacted between females among themselves
where the emotion of jealousy is absent.</p>

<p>The love of sensual people to look at obscene pictures or
to read obscene books is also based upon the impulse of mixoscopy.
Sometimes the intensity of the desire to assist at erotic
scenes reaches such a degree that the patients hire furnished
rooms in fornicibus observandi causa actiones between the inmates
and their callers, through holes in the walls of adjoining
rooms, and thus participate in their libido.</p>

<p>To this impulse of mixoscopy may also be attributed the
indulgent behavior of many a husband towards the family friend.
If the world is ignorant of their wives’ relations, and ridicule is
avoided, some husbands not only close their eyes to their wives'
doings but even favor their flirtations. The history of the following
case shows how far a husband can go in his indulgence,
as to himself procuring a lover for his wife:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. E., twenty-four years of age, decides to leave his country and
go to America. While waiting a few days for his boat to clear the
port, he spent one evening in a restaurant. After sitting there for
some time, he noticed a couple entering the same hostelry. The woman
was about thirty years of age, the man about twenty-five her senior.
The couple soon left the place. About an hour later the man returned,
sat down at the same table where E. was sitting and soon entered
into a conversation with him. In the course of their talk, the old man
asked E. whether he would like to have female company for the evening.
Upon the affirmative answer, the old man took E. to an aristocratic
apartment in a distinguished part of the city. There E. met
with the young lady he saw entering the restaurant, et cum ea
pernoctavit, the old man spending all this time in an adjoining
room. The following day the old man prevailed on E. to give
up the trip to America for a while and stay with them. E. stood this
idle life for six months, but finally his rôle as a commaritus or rather
as a fornicator came home to his conscience and he left for America.
While he was staying there he learned that the elderly man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
and the young woman were husband and wife. E. gave the author
the assurance that during the entire six months the husband, this he is
positively sure, never approached his wife sexually. He left her to
E. without manifesting the least trace of jealousy.</p></blockquote>

<p>The only explanation for such a strange phenomenon is
that the husband was impotent and that the only way for him
to experience at least some pleasure from his wife was by identifying
himself with the lover. Such cases represent the extreme
degree of mixoscopy.</p>

<p><i>Erotomania.</i>—The increased sexual desire in hyperaesthesia
is not always directed upon the physical gratification. Sometimes
it is more of an ideal nature, as in erotomania.</p>

<p>Physiological erotomania is often found in individuals of
both sexes, especially in young girls, at the time of puberty.
Many a youth and maiden are highly erotic, at this period, although,
if reared in purity and attended with vigilance, they
never think yet of the physical contact.</p>

<p>The erotomaniac individual’s love is of a platonic nature.
Erotomania constitutes a diseased form of ideal love. The
physical sexual appetite is generally foreign to the erotomaniac.
The object of the individual’s love occupies the mind only. It
is a continual obsession of the spirit. The erotomaniac individual
makes an abstraction of the physical personality of the
adored. It is pursuing an ideal. The erotomaniac is the victim
of a mental exaltation which moves the lover to write poetry
and love-letters to the object of his or her dreams, without ever
sending them off. If possible the erotomaniac follows his or
her lover, but never addresses a word to him or her. The erotomaniac
wishes to be in possession of the beloved being, to be
wedded to the beloved one, but it never thinks of the sensual
part. It is after the mental possession of the beloved one.</p>

<p>The love of the erotomaniac individual rests upon a vague
and hazy ideal. It is the purest love possible. The relation is
sacred and beautiful. It is a kind of cult. The beloved object
is a divinity whom the patient worships upon his or her knees
and whom he and she takes care not to profane even by a carnal
kiss.</p>

<p>The following case of a fellow-worker in the pathological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
institute of a university in Switzerland is not uninstructive in
this respect:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>While working over the microscope at the same table, the young
physician told the author the following story of his life when he was a
boy of sixteen. He was at that time attending college in a middle-sized
city in Germany. One day a college friend took him to his home,
where he saw his friend’s sister, a young lady of twenty-three years of
age, and immediately fell in love with her.</p>

<p>Although he was, already at that time, far enough advanced in the
ways of the world to see the hopelessness of his love, still the incongruity
between the ideal and reality was entirely forgotten. He was
altogether oblivious of the material world and imagined himself floating
in the realms of the spirits, while dreaming of exquisite harmonies.</p>

<p>Day and night he saw before him the object of his adoration.
He was filled with ecstasy over her perfection which was greatly exaggerated
and only existed in his imagination. For now, with a clearer
judgment, he can see distinctly that she must have had noticed at that
time his childish emotions and, out of vanity, was somewhat playing
with them. In his diaries he finds pledges of perennial veneration and
worship and vows of eternal resignation. His memoirs are filled with
descriptions of his hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, wishes and despairs.</p>

<p>While in her company, he became entirely unconscious of the flight
of time; when she was talking about the most trivial incidents, he
imagined that he was listening to the music of the spheres. Every
word, every motion of her was able to awaken in him either excessive
joy and excitement or to throw him into a state of despair and rob him
of his appetite and sleep for a number of days.</p>

<p>Happily, the young lady soon married a judge, and this marriage
broke the boy’s spell. It may be added that the hero of our story, now
a promising pathologist, is still of a very nervous temperament, and
though possessed of a strictly logical mind, he loves to frequent spiritualistic
séances and to participate in spiritualistic practices.</p></blockquote>

<p>The erotomaniac woman shows often characteristics not
always found in men. She is generally well satisfied with herself
and extremely vain. She is, as a rule, in love with a person
of high social and intellectual position. He is a prince, a celebrated
statesman, a victorious general, a famous actor, a brilliant
preacher, or a great scientist. In religious mania, it is not
seldom a saint who inspires the erotomaniac woman with a chaste
love. Sometimes a picture or a statue may become the object
of her adoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>As a general rule, the wish for the possession of a certain
man is provoked by his character, by his intellectual, moral or
physical qualities. If the man she fancies fails to attain to the
standard of her ideals she nevertheless attributes to him all the
charms her mind is able to conjure up. A case recorded by
Reuardin is a good example of erotomania in women.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, a well-educated lady, thirty-two years of age, notices
some time after her marriage a man of higher social standing than her
husband. She at once falls in love with this man, begins to grumble
at her low social position, and speaks of her husband only with contempt.
Her beloved one only has all the best qualities. No one is
above him. She writes letters to him, in which she reveals the most
ardent passion and, at the same time, the chastest emotions. Sometimes
she is found in ecstasy, with eyes fixed upon some chimerical
vision, the pupils in a state of hallucination and the lips murmuring
the beloved one’s name. She recoils from her husband’s caresses, refuses
to share his bed, to sit near him, speak to him and to see him.
Her whole life is centered in her love; her eyes are constantly fixed
upon the beloved image. Finally she becomes entirely insufferable and
commits so many extravagances that her husband is forced to separate
from her and later on to send her to an asylum.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ball distinguishes two categories of erotomaniacs. Some
are discreet lovers. They never accost the object of their love
and do not even feel the need to approach the divine hearth,
whence the spark started that inflamed their hearts. It is a
pure immaterial fire that feeds on itself. The other category,
the indiscreet lovers, feel the necessity to impart the knowledge
of their passion to the object that gave it rise.</p>

<p><i>Satyriasis and nymphomania.</i>—Contrary to erotomania, the
sexual impulse in satyriasis and in nymphomania is directed
upon the physical side of love. In these cases the impulse of
detumescence is greatly increased. The desires are directed
upon the physical, pleasurable titillations of the sexual organs.</p>

<p>The dividing line between the normal and pathological increase
of libido is not readily found. The libido sexualis normally
varies in different individuals. Married life bridles, as a
rule, sexual desire, while intercourse with different persons increases
it. Total sexual abstinence may cause in certain individuals,
with a neurotic taint, increased sexual desire, continuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
excitement, diseased, unconquerable impulse for sexual congress,
and the preoccupation of the entire attention upon the sensual
act.</p>

<p>The immediate reawakening of desire after normal satisfaction
and the excitation of libido by the sight of persons and
things which in themselves should have but indifferent or no
sexual effects, are decidedly abnormal.</p>

<p>If the increase of the impulse is only moderate, so that
increased frequency of conjugal embrace is able to appease somewhat
the increased desire, the anomaly generally finds expression
in a desire for female respectively male society, in the reading
of erotic or obscene literature, in dancing, flirting, etc. But
if the increase of the sexual desire has reached the degree of
true satyriasis in men or nymphomania in women, the anomaly
is characterized by an irresistible exaltation and an insatiable
appetite for sexual gratification. At the mere sight of a woman
satyriasis gets into such a state of excitement, as to experience
real orgasm.</p>

<p>Satyriasis is not seldom confounded with priapism. But
the latter is in no respect a psycho-sexual anomaly at all. It is
a nervous trouble of one of the genital organs and has nothing
in common with satyriasis. On the contrary, in priapism the
potencies of voluptas as well as that of experiencing libido are
generally decreased, as Tarnowsky’s case shows (L’instinct
sexuel, p. 150).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Benj. Tarnowsky observed a case of priapism in a soldier which
had lasted for over two years and had prevented the patient from
absolving his active military service. The complete erection of the
organ continually existed in a chronic state and never ceased for a
moment. The organ did not wilt even after several coitions, which, in
the beginning of his sickness, were tried by the patient in order to
free himself from the annoying state of affairs. In the course of his
sickness, coition, and especially ejaculation, caused him such violent
pains that commixtio was never tried again. Voluptuous thoughts and
sexual desire had entirely disappeared. Even the thought of coition
caused the patient disagreeable sensations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Priapism, therefore, if it were at all a disease of a sexual
nature, would more properly belong among the anomalies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
sexual anaesthesia. Satyriasis, on the other hand, is a psycho-sexual
anomaly of increased sexual desire. Scarcely has the
desire been appeased, when it returns with the same force and
vigor as before. The following case may serve as an illustration
of such class of cases.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. X., a soldier, twenty-three years of age, in prostibulum
meretricem visit, qua concubit, pretium usitatum resolvit et relinquit.
Scarcely did he reach the door of her room, cum voluptas resurgeret.
Itaque revenit, iterum eam comprimit, resolvit et relinquit. This time
he managed to descend half the stairs, cum voluptas experrecta esset.
Qua re redit, actionem repetit, resolvit et relinquit. But he had no
time to come down the stairs, cum concitatus esset. Quo modo sexies
ad puellam reveniebat, until he had no more money for her services and
had to leave her, but not yet entirely satisfied.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a case represents a true sexual neurosis of insatiable
lust. In the pronounced cases of satyriasis, the individual is
the personification of sexuality. In his proximity everything
turns upon sex. Nothing is suffered to prevail but sexual emotions.
Every glance, motion or word of his has a sex coloring.
He is nothing but a demoniac sex-creature. Every word he
utters has an obscene emotional tone. His exclamations of surprise,
fear, anger, etc., are all borrowed from the realm of sex.
He is a screaming vortex of lubescent lubricity. A continual
lustful scent exudes from him. He is perennially in quest for
sexual gratification. He tries to excite every woman he comes
in contact with and is himself excited by her. Moral consideration
is an unknown quantity for him. The inhibitions, normally
emanating from the cerebral centre, are destroyed in him. He
is continually bent on new sensations.</p>

<p>This picture of the evil spirit of satyriasis is still surpassed
by nymphomania. The woman suffering from nymphomania is
more excessive in her demands than the man afflicted with
satyriasis.</p>

<p>The border-line between the normal and pathological increase
of libido in women is also somewhat blotted. A considerable
piece of sexuality dwells in the feminine soul of every woman.
It is only covered by inhibitory counter-emotions. But we recog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>nize
her true sexuality by its pathological exaggeration. Never
is there uncovered in insane men such an abundance and monstrosity
of the sexual imagery as in insane women. In dreams
and in the dusky twilight of insanity men and women abandon
themselves to their true impulses and desires without the restraining
influences of conventionality. The normal woman has
learned by education to hide her true sexual feelings and was
forced by tradition to produce in a quite extraordinary way the
impression that she herself is nearly non-sexual, and her sexuality
is only a concession to the man. But judging from her
sexual emotions in abnormal states, the intensity of woman’s
sexuality is of a higher degree than that of the man’s, and herein
lies woman’s superior morality. Morality is the arrest of the
instincts by the intellect. The intensity of her desires being
greater, her higher chastity is more laudable. In certain periods,
such as pregnancy and lactation, when woman is really more or
less non-sexual, her chastity has no merit. But in the other
states of her life when woman’s desires possess a higher degree
of intensity, her chastity is of a superior kind.</p>

<p>Thus the determination, when the normal increase of woman’s
sexual desire ceases and the abnormal state begins, is
wrought with great difficulty. Sexual inclination is normally
increased immediately before and after the menses. Still it
may be laid down as a rule that an overweening sexual desire
in a woman, considering her natural modesty and coyness, should
arouse suspicion of its pathological significance.</p>

<p>The nymphomaniac woman seeks to attract men by indecent
language, by lascivious conduct, by personal adornment, perfumes,
talk of marriage, by the exhibition of her feet, legs, neck,
breasts and other parts of her body, and, at the height of her
excitement by invitation ad congressum, aperto stupro manu,
nudatione muliebrium et motionibus initus pelve. She is
often seen in the physician’s office and desires gynaecological
examinations for the gratification of her excitement. Such a
case was recently observed by the author.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, about forty years of age, was suffering from endometritis
and came to the office for treatment. At the first touch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the introitus vaginae by the finger, the patient suddenly agitata est.
She tightly closed her eyes, the respiration became panting, the abdominal
muscles contracted, which made the combined examination
impossible, her face became red, her entire body was seized by a convulsive
tremor, and her pelvis made omnes motiones commixtionis vehementis.
At the end of one or two minutes the paroxysm ended with
a deep sigh, and the examination could be continued. The attacks were
repeated at the beginning of every treatment, and the same had to be
discontinued. Without offending the patient, she was told that she
needs a curettage. This advice caused her to stay away from the office.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the pronounced cases of nymphomania, the woman will
accept the embraces of any man and will solicit even boys.
To him who yields to her wiles she brings misery and calamity.
She is an object of attraction and carries ruin in her lap for
those who become the slaves of her eroticism. A piece of destructive
sexuality dwells in the bosom of these women, something
of the Delilah-nature, for all who come in contact with
them. They consume men’s strength and vigor physiologically
and psychologically.</p>

<p>The nymphomaniac woman is not able to free herself from
the thraldom of eroticism. Her sexual instinct is irresistible and
untamable. Nymphomania leads the sufferer to any degradation,
to the practice assidui stupri manu and even to bestiality.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Magnan mentions the case of a lady of forty-seven years of age,
who from her early childhood manifested excessive voluptas. She
was always nervous, eccentric, and of a romantic disposition. When
she was only ten years old she began to practice concarnationem. At
the age of nineteen she got married, but although her husband was
sexually perfectly normal, he could not satisfy her often enough. Qua
re jugiter cum aliis viris commiscebatur, and although this infidelity
made her entirely unhappy and miserable, she was powerless to overcome
her insatiable desires.</p>

<p>In another case of Magnan, the patient had a passion for men
from her earliest youth. She was of good family, well bred, of pleasant
disposition, and exceedingly modest. As a little girl she was the terror
of the family. Scarcely was she alone with any male, child or adult,
statim aperiebat muliebria et poscebat satisfactionem voluptatis, even
going so far as to lay hold of the person. Marriage did not cure her
intense desire. She loved her husband passionately, yet indiscriminately
petebat placationem voluptatis a quovis viro with whom she hap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>pened
to be alone, were he her servant, laborer, or even school-boy.
This insatiable passion continued to possess her after she had become
a grandmother. At the age of sixty-five she was yet recklessly passionate
as before.</p></blockquote>

<p>The anomaly of nymphomania is generally due to a cerebral
lesion. Hence little relief can be afforded by the removal
of the clitoris or the ovaries, or by any other therapeutic measure.
The affection shows all the stigmata of degeneration and moral
insanity. The nymphomaniac woman belongs to the type of
the “deliquenta nata.”</p>

<p>Nymphomania is often found in periodical insanity. The
case of Anjel is a good illustration.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, near the climacteric period, is nowise of a passionate
nature, sexually, but after a hystero-epileptic attack has the impulse to
embrace and kiss boys, about ten years of age et contrectare virilia.
She has no desire for coition while suffering from the attack.
In the intervals she is very modest.</p></blockquote>

<p>This paedophilia in women, suffering from hyperaesthesia,
is not rare. The patients are intensely excited by young boys,
while they possess only normal inclination toward adults.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Magnan’s case is interesting in this respect. The patient was a
lady twenty-nine years of age. For eight years she had a strong desire
complexus venerei with one of her five nephews. First her desire went
toward the oldest boy, when he was five years of age. Then she transferred
this desire to each of them in turn as they grew up. The sight
of the child in question was sufficient to produce ejaculation and
orgasm.</p></blockquote>

<p>The case of Kisch is interesting for the coincidence of
paedophilia with traces of homosexuality.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient is thirty years of age, married nine years, but sterile.
Coition gives her not only no pleasure, but on the contrary, it causes
her a feeling of disgust. But she feels irresistibly impelled contrectare
pudibilia of children, no matter whether male or female. These
manipulations induce ejaculation and orgasm. At the time of her menstruation
this impulse is stronger than her power of resistance.</p>

<p>In Krafft-Ebing’s case the patient, a teacher, thirty years of age
and of strict morality, enticed a boy of five who happened to play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
nearby, under the promise of money and food ut veniret in cubiculum.
“Ibi genitalibus pueri aliquamdiu lusit, denique introductionem penis
in vaginam tentavit.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In hysterical women hyperaesthesia sexualis is of frequent
occurrence.<a id="FNanchor_BA_53" href="#Footnote_BA_53" class="fnanchor">BA</a> Giraud’s case is of great interest, showing how
far the aberration may proceed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The girl, a domestic servant, was always moral before her illness.
When she began suffering from hysterical attacks, amato liberos in
fidem suam commissos exhibebat ad constuprandum et noctu spectatores
rerum turpium eos faciebat, while the whole household was asleep
under the influence of narcotics. When she was discovered and driven
out of the house, the formerly modest girl became shameless and finally
meretricium fecit.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another type of hyperaesthesia which borders on a real
psychosis, is represented by one of Schrenk-Notzing’s cases.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient would become sexually excited to a high degree at the
mere sight or touch of a man, et se satiebat congressu imaginali aut
stupro manu fricando femora ultro citroque. For a long time attacks
of genital erethism were brought on every morning. Once
it happened in the physician’s office. Notwithstanding the presence of
three male witnesses, she threw herself on a lounge and, in hysterical
convulsions, se feminavit several times before their eyes.</p>

<p>Brouardel relates the case of a girl of sixteen who would lie in the
ditch of a highway and, aperiens muliebria lacessebat præterientes viros
ad concarnationem. Nothing could be done to make her desist and she
had to be sent to a house of correction.</p>

<p>In another case, the daughter of a physician, a friend of Brouardel’s,
ran away from her father’s home at the age of sixteen and
in fornicem iniit in Paris to appease her sexual desires. Nothing could
induce her to return home.</p></blockquote>

<p>This case throws some light upon the etiology of prostitution.
Not all prostitutes are driven to their degrading trade by
idleness or necessity, as some philanthropists or socialists would
like to make us believe. Not a few choose this life to satisfy
their nymphomaniac desires.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Trélat tells of a young girl, the daughter of a professor who, at
the age of fifteen, milites noctu fenestra cubiculi admittebat ad satiandam
voluptatem.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>The best and most careful rearing of girls, suffering from
nymphomania, can not save them from downfall. In their wild
passion, casting all moral and social considerations aside, they
throw themselves into the arms of sin. The more they abandon
themselves to the gratification of their lust, the greater is the
desire of their morbidly excited nerve-centres for lecherous satisfaction.
Every indulgence increases the desire and lessens the
capacity, as Horace truly says:</p>

<p>
“Crescit indulgens sibi durus hydrops.”<br />
</p>

<p>The woman loses control of her passions, and can not restrain
herself from stuprum manu aut concubitus. She becomes absorbed
in sexual gratification, as seen in the case reported by Reti:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient lived happily with her husband until after the birth
of her first child. From that moment she became a slave of her insatiable
lust. An irresistible craving suddenly took hold of her, an
indomitable lust seized her to embrace men. She felt a morbid itching
in muliebribus, an inexplicable excitement, a burning desire for sexual
gratification. In the beginning her husband tried to satisfy her until
he discovered his impossibility to do so. She did not allow an hour
of the day to pass without demanding gratification from her husband.
He was terrified to see her premere muliebria to the edge of the
table or against the door or any other hard subject, in order to satisfy
her sensual appetite. When she became worse from day to day, her
husband took her to the hospital for examination. At the introduction
of the speculum, a morbid contraction of the constrictor cunni
muscle occurred suddenly. The touch of the carunculae myrtiformes
provoked intense pain. After surmounting the obstacle, however, the
pain ceased and a blissful rapture appeared. “Now! Now!” exclaims
the patient, when the entire speculum was within the vagina. A convulsive
movement seized her entire body, a thrill went through her, et
motiones vehementis congressus fecit.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some nymphomaniac women have illusions of coition.
Such a case has been reported by Rosse.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A comely young woman who suffered from nymphomania practised
stuprum manu to excess and declared one day that several persons,
among them her clergyman, se constupraverunt. The sexual excitability
in this case was exaggerated to such an extent that the
mere sight of a man, even of the attending physician, suggested a
repetition of the act to provoke the venereal spasm. So persistent
was the habit that on tying her hands se feminavit with her heel. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
prevent this her feet were secured, but she succeeded in bringing about
an orgasm fricando femora ultro citroque ita ut clitoridem excitaret.
The patient died at a retreat.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the hyperaesthetic woman is unable to satisfy her desires
she shows all the symptoms of general neurasthenia. Especially
does she suffer from neuralgia of the ovaries. The case of
Rohleder is the best example of the disturbances unsatisfied
nymphomania may cause.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, a girl of eighteen, and a member of a family of good
social standing, was engaged to be married. Until she was sixteen and
a half years of age she was always well. At that time she made
the acquaintance of her intended. Then a great change took place
in her disposition. She became very nervous and moody. Now she was
very gay, but a moment later became deeply melancholy. Her menstruation
was regular, but at that period she suffered great pains at the
ovaries, especially before the menses set in. When she met with her
fiancé her pains increased so that they caused convulsions. She could find
some relief stupro manu. After she got married, all the symptoms disappeared.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Masturbation.</i>—The anomaly of masturbation is the most
common sexual aberration, and if found in the very young it
assumes the dignity of a perversity. In the adult, masturbation,
if practised with moderation, can not be considered pathological.
According to Paget masturbation causes no more nor less harm
than normal coitus, if practised with the same frequency and
under the same conditions with regard to health, age and
circumstances.</p>

<p>Prof. Oscar Berger (Archiv f. Psychiatrie, Vol. VI, 1876)
says masturbation is such a frequent manipulation that out of
a hundred boys and girls ninety-nine have temporarily been
addicted to it, and the hundredth, the so-called pure individual,
is concealing the truth. Moll quotes a physician as saying:
“Whoever denies having masturbated, has often only forgotten
it; whoever claims of never having masturbated is still doing it.”</p>

<p>Now, giving due allowance to the exaggeration of these
authors in the heat of the discussion, the truth remains that
the greater part of humanity has one time or another practised
autoeroticism. If what the quacks and ignoramuses tell us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
about its dangers be true, humanity ought to have passed into
oblivion long ago, or at least ought to have entirely degenerated.
But we are all still alive, hale and healthy, hence moderate masturbation
can not have the disastrous effects which some authors
are pleased to describe.</p>

<p>Erb (Handbuch für Rückenmarkkrankheiten, p. 163) says,
the effects upon the nervous system in a man must be essentially
the same, whether the frictions of the glans take place in the
vagina or are carried out in any other way. The nervous shock
of ejaculation remains the same, and the nervous excitement
ought to be greater where the female is used. Hence masturbation,
moderately practised, exercises no direct destroying effects
upon a good constitution.</p>

<p>Moderate masturbation seems to be almost a natural phenomenon.
Even among animals various forms of spontaneous
solitary sexual excitement are observed.</p>

<p>Dogs masturbate by rubbing the organ with their hind-feet,
or by crossing the hind-legs or lambendo fascinum lingua.</p>

<p>The stag, when in heat, rubs his penis against trees until he
effects ejaculation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Porocz saw in a zoological garden an elephant, who was in the
habit of masturbating himself so often that he undermined his health
and had to be sold.</p>

<p>Prange (Revue vétér. 1856) describes a stallion that with his
mentulato fascino could reach his forelegs and thus rub the organ against
them. In this way he induced three to four ejaculations daily.</p>

<p>The author observed a baboon in the zoological park se constuprantem
by quickly and repeatedly pulling with his fore-foot or hand
the prepuce until ejaculation took place.</p></blockquote>

<p>Masturbation is further found among peoples of nearly
every race, however natural the conditions are under which men
and women live. Masturbation was known among all races at
every period of history. It is reported that the great Cynic
Diogenes practised autoeroticism publicly in his tub.</p>

<p>Schools, academies, educational institutions, dormitories of
colleges, factories or prisons are hot-beds of masturbation.
Prof. Schiller published the observations in a certain gymnasium<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
(collegiate high school) where the boys had holes in the pockets
of their trousers ad stuprum mutuum faciendum during the
lessons, in the presence of their professors.</p>

<p>Thomalla knows of a boarding school where bets are made
among the boys on the skill of their exercitatio stuprosa. The
boy who can induce the ejectio seminis the quickest receives
the prize.</p>

<p>Walter Benseman (Public School and Gymnasium) describes
the most deplorable conditions existing in a great many
boarding schools in England.</p>

<p>In France, Deville and Tarnowsky found the spread of
masturbation in schools, colleges and pensionates to be enormous.</p>

<p>Male masturbation, as a rule, is effected by fricando glandem
manu. Hence such mishaps, as often happen in woman,
are of rare occurrence. Still many queer objects were found
in the male urethra or bladder, such as quills, pencils,
penholders, blades of straw, knitting needles, pieces of bougies
or of catheters, ear-spoons, tooth-picks, all introduced for masturbating
purposes. Senn removed in a young man, nineteen
years of age, a stem of a plant from the bladder, which was
introduced into the bladder for autoerotic purposes. The author
removed a pencil from the pars membranacea of a boy of
eighteen, through an incision in this part.</p>

<p>Such cases are exceedingly rare in the male. As a rule,
autoeroticism in men is accomplished by the hand alone, hence
the name “masturbation.” In some cases neither the hand
nor any other means is needed to obtain the desired end. The
fancy of concarnatio alone will produce the orgasm, as in the
following case, told the author in confidence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young man, twenty years of age, while sitting behind an attractive
young lady in theatre, was in the habit of allowing his fancy
free rein by imagining himself of being in complexu venereo with his fair
neighbor. This thought alone sufficed to induce ejaculation and orgasm.
One Sunday while sitting near a fair worshipper in church, he got so
excited that he had to practise ideal congressum cum ea during the
sermon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The causes of masturbation are different at the different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
periods of the individual’s life. In early childhood, a neuropathic
predisposition, eczema, pruritus, phimosis, accumulation
of smegma, early retiring and late rising, spicy food and exciting
drinks, absolute ignorance of sex and seduction by vicious
servants will be the principal causes for autoeroticism. During
the time of school-life seduction is the cause par excellence of
masturbation. Self-abuse is widely spread in schools. No institution
is free from it. In nearly every school there is at least
one lecherous boy who is apt to be peculiarly fascinating to his
fellows and who will promulgate the habit. In some schools the
evil reaches a wide extension. The tradition of the school and
the material of the pupils is of great influence. Particularly
dangerous, as hatcheries and divulgers of the evil, are those institutions
in which numerous pupils are present who have passed
the normal age by several years. They come, as a rule, from
the country to enter the advanced classes. The time of puberty
is another period favorable for acquiring the habit of masturbation.
When the genital centres are fully developed, the individual
gets a conscious realization of its sexual power, and the
psychological reactions of animal passion manifest themselves
in the desire to cause a relaxation and a discharge of the nervous
tension and of the physical genital congestion. The opportunity
for the natural discharge being connected with great difficulties,
especially for the girl, there is danger that the child will resort
to masturbation to be relieved from the nervous tension and
the material congestion.</p>

<p>During the post-puberty period which in men reaches to
the twenty-fourth year and in women to the twentieth year of
age, the extension of the masturbatic practices gradually decreases,
and by the time manhood and womanhood have been
reached, masturbation has almost entirely disappeared. Its
presence after this period may be considered pathological except
it is practised out of necessity as in the following case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. A., thirty-five years old, married twelve years, father of two
healthy children, was always well. Three years ago he left his native
country and came to America. Faute de mieux, he began to practise
autoeroticism inordinately and continued in this practice until he be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>came
a nervous wreck, showing all the symptoms of neurasthenia besides
impotence and nocturnal emissions.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this case the patient became perfectly well after his
wife arrived in this country.</p>

<p>While moderate masturbation at certain periods of life is
almost a natural phenomenon, masturbation practised inordinately
is the most disastrous psycho-sexual disease. There is
in the first place general neurasthenia, with all its accompanying
symptoms, as photopsias, glistening and dazzling before the
eyes, photophobias, dry conjunctivitis, particularly found among
masturbating girls and old maids, and functional sexual disturbances,
as diurnal pollutions and spermatorrhoea. Other
symptoms are indolence, lack of energy, shyness in demeanor,
want of self-reliance, disinclination to study, incapacity of
serious work, shortness of memory, absent-mindedness, unsteadiness
of character, hypochondria and melancholia.</p>

<p>The children become peevish and irritable, they are reserved
in conversation, apathetic in manner, hesitating in actions, slovenly
in dress, and contradictory. Cerebral anemia is of common
occurrence among those addicted to excesses in masturbation.
Vertigo is hence a common symptom, and fainting spells
are not rare. Girls especially are liable to be affected by syncope.
Palpitation and arythmia of the heart is very common. Perspiration
breaks forth on the slightest exertion, and the slightest
exercise occasions shortness of breath. Neuralgia of the testicles,
ovaries and the bladder is frequently found in these patients.
The patient is frequently seized with the desire to pass water.
The calls to urinate are particularly frequent in the morning
hours, while in the afternoon and in the night-time the calls
are less urgent. Particular danger of long-continued masturbation
lies in the development of impotency in men and frigidity
in women.</p>

<p>One of the most disastrous effects of excessive masturbation,
an effect which has also a sociological bearing, is that it renders
the patient unfit for marriage, not only because it is so often
the cause of impotence, but because the dreams which accompany
the masturbatic acts are not realized in marriage, and the
patient returns to his former pastime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>Another most harmful effect of excessive masturbation is
the weakness of the will which becomes more and more pronounced
until it finally ends in aboulia. The patient is affected
by a complete inability to act as he feels.</p>

<p><i>Masturbation in women.</i>—In former times masturbation
was considered an exclusively male vice. Very few even among
the profession dreamt of the widely-spread masturbatic practices
in the female sex. Nowadays we have progressed. We have
learned that even in this respect perfect equality reigns among
the sexes. Even female animals make no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>Mares rub themselves against objects. Stags, in the rutting
season, when they have no mates, rub themselves against trees.
Mammary masturbation is found in certain females like the
dog or cat. Apes are given to masturbation even in freedom
and use their hands.</p>

<p>Female masturbation is further found among peoples of
every race and every clime and in every period of history.</p>

<p>Among the ancients the Lesbian women are said to have
used ivory fascini or golden ones, covered with silken stuffs
or linen, in solitary sexual gratification. Aristophanes relates
the use by the Milesian women of the “olisbos,” an artificial
leather mentula.</p>

<p>The Hebrew women also knew the use of the artificial phallus,
as stated by Ezekiel (xvi, 17). ותעשי לך צלמי זכר ותזני בם
“Et fecisti tibi imagines masculinas et fornicata es in eis.”</p>

<p>Fritsch found masturbation common among the young
women of the Nama Hottentots. It is regarded there as the
custom of the country. The same is the case among the Basutos
and the Kaffirs.</p>

<p>The Spaniards found the women in the Philippines addicted
to masturbation. It was customary to use an artificial fascinum
and other abnormal methods of sexual gratification.</p>

<p>Jacobs found among the Balinese masturbation to be a
common practice. The women employ a wax fascinum, to the
use of which they devote many hours of solitude.</p>

<p>Throughout the East masturbation is prevalent, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
among young girls. In Cochin-China it is most practised
by married women.</p>

<p>The Japanese women use two hollow balls of the size of a
pigeon’s egg. One is empty, the other contains a small, but
heavy metal ball, or some quicksilver, so that if the balls are
held in hand side by side there is a continuous movement. Pila
inanis primo in vaginam immittitur eo modo ut uterum tangat,
deinde altera inducitur. The slightest movement of the pelvis
or the thighs causes the metal or the mercury ball to roll,
and the resulting vibration produces a prolonged voluptuous
titillation, a gentle shock, as from a weak electric inductive
apparatus. Pilae in vagina arboris lana retinentur. The women
then delight to swing themselves in hammocks or rocking chairs,
the delicate vibrations of the balls slowly producing the highest
degree of libido.</p>

<p>Thus the phenomenon of spontaneous sexual emotion is
found in animals as well as among savages, and in every period
of human history. No wonder that the conditions of modern
civilization, with its artificial mode of living, render auto-erethism
a frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>The extent of this practice among women may be judged
from the occasionally resulting mishaps that reach the surgeon’s
hands. Bananas are often used feminandi causa. Country
girls often use cucumbers in stuprando.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The author once removed a carrot from the vagina, which a young
woman had used to obtain erotic gratification.</p>

<p>In another case, while trying to dilate the cervical canal preliminary
to curettage for persistent leucorrhoea, he found a hair-pin in the
canal which, as the girl afterwards confessed, had slipped out of her
hand while tickling the external os of the cervix.</p>

<p>At another occasion, as house-physician in a European surgical
clinic, the author assisted in the removal of a hair-pin from the bladder
of a young woman, which was used to produce a tickling sensation of the
clitoris, and which accidentally slipped into the urethra, and then entered
the bladder.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other objects removed by surgeons are pencils, bodkins,
knitting-needles, crochet-needles, penholders, quills, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>Some women produce sexual excitement by frictions against
the corner of a chair, table, etc.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Morris relates of a lady, a devout church member, who never had
allowed herself to entertain any sexual thoughts referring to men.
Tamen se stuprabat every morning while standing before the mirror by
rubbing against a key in the bureau drawer.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most common means to produce voluptificam
titillationem, that is even found in use by children, when scarcely
more than infants, is the voluntary pressure of the thighs. They
are placed together and firmly crossed while the pelvis is rocked,
so that the sexual organs are pressed against the inner and
posterior parts of the thighs. Townsend records five cases of
thigh friction in children less than one year old.</p>

<p>The manipulation of the sewing machine with the body on
the edge of the seat is sometimes used by young women as a
means to produce sexual excitement, leading to orgasm. Horseback
riding is sometimes employed as a means for inducing
orgasm and ejaculation in women. The stimulation caused by
bicycle riding is not seldom prolonged by women until orgasm
is induced.</p>

<p>Besides masturbation by means of tactile excitation, ideal
auto-erethism is widely spread among women. The votaries
induce sexual libido by means of lustful conceptions and
thoughts. The mere thought concubitus induces orgasm and ejaculation
in such women. Such women are able to practice auto-erethism
at all times and in all places. While riding in crowded
cars and upon the most serious occasions, in churches and in
other sacred places, the mere libidinous thought of being in concarnatione
induces orgasm. These voluptuous dreamers may
stuprare without any visible manipulations while conversing
with their friends or listening to a sermon.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young lady of twenty-five prefers to ride in crowded street
cars and, if possible, refuses to accept a seat when offered by a sympathetic
man, but remains standing before him, holding on to the strap.
She then indulges in ideal auto-erethism by fancying herself of being in
concarnatione viri ante se sedentis, cujus genua tentat quam sæpessime
tangere suis genibus. At one occasion while riding in a crowded car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
and standing before a man who was interested in reading a book,
pressit suis genibus viri genu during the orgasm in such a way that
the man, a physician, looked up to see what was going on. The glowing
face was in a state of extreme excitement. The staring eyes were fixed
on one point, the hands holding the strap were trembling. Respiration
was panting and the countenance distorted to a veritable grimace.</p></blockquote>

<p>With some women even lustful thoughts are not required
to induce sexual libido. They are found among women who are
the victims of sexual repression. They restrain themselves from
attaining orgasm in the natural way for moral or social reasons.
Occasionally the internal stimuli overmaster them and bring
about a sexual paroxysm, in the absence of any external stimulus
and without resorting to ideal congressus.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sérieux records the case of a woman, fifty years of age, who lived
a chaste life. At times violent crises of sexual paroxysms would come
on without any accompaniment of voluptuous thoughts or any mechanical
help.</p></blockquote>

<p>In some patients orgasm may be induced by means of sensory
impressions, as by listening to music or the sight of nature
in the country, and by the taste and touch of things which have
no bearing upon the sexual parts whatever.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Schrenk-Notzing records the case of a female masturbator who induced
orgasm without any tactile manipulation, simply by listening to
music or while regarding paintings that displayed nothing of a lascivious
character.</p>

<p>Another of his patients became sexually excited by the sight of the
grandeur of nature, as by the sea, or high mountains.</p>

<p>With another of his patients the mere sight of a specially strong
and sympathetic man immediately brings on orgasm.</p>

<p>In Ellis’ case the patient, while still a young girl, whenever a
certain artist, whom she admired, touched her hand, felt erections and
moisture in muliebribus. When her uncle’s knee once accidentally
came in contact with her thigh, ejaculation took place. Once, casually
seeing virilia, a convulsive ejaculation occurred accompanied by a delightful
sensation, every fibre tingling with an exquisite glow of warmth.</p>

<p>One of the author’s hysterical patients became greatly excited
sexually whenever she ate liver-sausages.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>Another kind of auto-erethism occurs during sleep. Pollutions
are accompanied in sleep by erotic dreams. At the height
of the paroxysm an abundant discharge from the Bartholinian
glands takes place. The orgasm in sleep is an autoerotic process
which is entirely normal. In women who have not yet experienced
orgasm in the waking state, the erotic phenomena during
sleep are usually of a very vague kind. The real orgasm that
awakes the sleeper and leaves its traces in the individual’s consciousness
occurs only after orgasm has been once induced in
the waking state. Erotic dreams occur in women more frequently
than is ordinarily thought of nowadays. It was better
known in the darker ages. Hence the wide-spread belief in
Lillith and Samaël, the evil spirits, that visit young maidens and
wives and also youths and husbands while in bed at night in
order to seduce them.</p>

<p>Sometimes automatic masturbation is practised during
sleep. The patient awakes to find her finger in the vagina.</p>

<p>If the pollutions occur at long intervals, they cause no
direct injury to a good constitution. But if the women are not
robust, and the pollutions happen too often, these drains are
the cause of considerable nervous depression.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the author’s patients, a widow of about forty years of age,
is suffering from almost nightly pollutions. These weaken her so much
that she is seldom able to rise before noon-time.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same deleterious effects are caused by all other kinds
of masturbatic practices. Even though we agree with Paget that
moderate masturbation is no more harmful than normal intercourse,
it can not be denied that masturbation, since opportunity
for it is ever present, is of far more frequent occurrence than
natural sexual indulgence. The habit, once established, masturbation
presents an unconquerable impulse and a resultant incapacity
to control it. It is then the cause of grave material injuries
to the nervous system. It dwarfs the entire female organism.
It makes the girl shy, offish, squeamish, repellent, and
weakens and sickens the emotions of sex-attraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span></p><blockquote>

<p>One of the author’s patients, a dress-maker, thirty-five years of
age and single, has been suffering from general nervousness, headaches,
palpitation of the heart, frequent urination, anorexia and constipation.
One day she took courage and asked for a remedy for her excessive autoeroticism.
Scarcely does she reach her bed at night time and gets warm,
when the overwhelming desire for autoeroticism takes a hold of her
and, fighting as she may against the impulse, ei feminandum est manu.
These practices were going on nightly for the last twenty years.</p></blockquote>

<p>Howard says: The permanent effects left from early masturbation
seem to be much graver in women than in men. As
the girl grows, her psychic life becomes more complicated, her
natural romantic nature is fed by kiss literature and poetry of
the decadents, in which perverted passion is thinly disinfected
by erotic mysticism. Under such a stimulating psychic pabulum
a dormant sexual volcano may become active. If it is
only smoldering, suggestive dressing, the dance and wine will
soon bring about the complete explosion. At home in bed, with
strange and abnormal psychic pictures, she will seek relief in
stupro manu. If this state of affairs is kept up for many years,
when she marries her husband is certain to find that he has for
a wife a female who has no use for normal sex activity and who
has acquired a perverted taste for some form of autoeroticism.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that autoeroticism is frequently practised
by married women living with sexually normal husbands. The
gynaecologist must consider this fact as the possible cause of
many female complaints.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A few years ago, the author removed an ovarian tumor and performed
a perinæorrhaphy on a woman of thirty-five, mother of a child
of ten years of age. While in the hospital the nurse complained that the
patient is soiling the wound contrectando muliebria. Three months
after the patient left the hospital she called at the author’s office
for treatment of ulcerations of the labia and nymphae. The clitoris
was found to be one inch long, bluish-red and inflamed, the prepuce swollen
and edematous, the nymphae inflamed and swollen. The author told the
patient that she could not be cured unless she desisted from autoeroticism
which she promised to do. This promise had the value of a confession
that she did indulge in autoerotic practices. Yet she had a
normal husband who very industriously performed his marital obligations.
For before the operation she once asked the author to tell her
husband not to have any connections, or at least, not so frequently,
with her until after the operation.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>The female masturbator often becomes excessively prudish,
despises and hates the opposite sex, and forms passionate attachments
for other women. Masturbation is not seldom the cause
of a great number of female complaints. It is often the cause
of obstruction and of pains of menstruation, of ovarian neuralgia,
of weakness of the legs and of sexual irritation. It causes pruritus
vulvae, hypertrophy of the clitoris and labia minora, hyperaemia
of the vaginal orifice, fluor albus, and cervical catarrh.
Masturbating women often complain of general weakness and of
palpitation of the heart.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the author’s patients, a young masturbator of seventeen,
suffered from painful menstruation, attacks of palpitation of the heart,
from melancholia and fear of death, and at the same time from suicidal
inclinations, which thus revealed the illogical state of her mind.</p></blockquote>

<p>Masturbation also causes that form of increased erethism,
connected with female impotency, in which the orgasm no longer
occurs during the conjugal embrace. For this reason the victim
prefers solitary indulgence even after marriage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Moll’s case the woman, thirty years of age, mother of several
children, is happily married, loves her husband and is loved in return.
Yet coition does not gratify her in the least. She finds satisfaction
only in solitary stupro manu by which orgasm is induced in the highest
degree. In this way there are times, when the patient who is a modest,
moral woman, practises autoeroticism several times a day.</p></blockquote>

<p>To this class of patients belong the cases recorded by Loiman,
Laker, and others. The sexual functions were originally
normal and satisfaction was possible in the normal way.
Through excessive masturbation, however, the nerves became
so weakened that normal coition did not give the desired satisfaction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Troggler’s case the woman had practised autoeroticism excessively
from her thirteenth year and found satisfaction fricando et
trahendo clitoridem. When she began to have normal concarnatio at the
age of eighteen, she found that she could not obtain satisfaction for her
excessively increased voluptuous desire except manuali fricando clitoridis
inter coitum.</p>

<p>In Laker’s case of a married woman, twenty-four years of age, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
patient never experienced the least satisfaction in concarnatione with
her husband, while she found the desired effect in autoeroticism, especially
in mutuo stupro manu.</p>

<p>In another of the same author’s cases a woman of thirty-four years
of age practised stuprum manu mutuum and found great satisfaction in
this activity. At the age of nineteen she was married and in spite of
mutual affection she could not experience any libido. This fact did not
prevent her from giving birth to two healthy children.</p>

<p>In another of Troggler’s cases, the woman, twenty-five years of age,
was induced to practise autoeroticism when eleven years of age. On
account of her increased sexual desires she began to have complexus
venereus when fifteen years old. But she could not find the least satisfaction
in congressu, although she practised it with a number of different
men. Only stuprum manu offered her the desired libido.</p>

<p>In Loiman’s case the patient was induced by her friends in the convent
to practise autoeroticism. When fourteen years of age she began
to indulge in stupro manibus mutuo cum pueris of her own age. She
married when nineteen years old and gave birth to her first child a year
later. But she never found gratification in the conjugal embrace. The
second case of Loiman was a widow of thirty-eight who had always been
normal in her sexual functions and gave birth to a child at the age of
twenty-seven. Two years later she lost her husband by death, and from
that time she began “faute de mieux” to stuprare manu. Her voluptas
increased to the point of becoming insatiable. When she has now normal
congressus cum multis amatis she cannot find the desired gratification
unless masturbatur in congressione.</p></blockquote>

<p>This last case shows that Freud’s explanation of frigidity of
intercourse by the refusal of the clitoris to transfer its sexuality
at the time of puberty does not always hold good. This woman
passed through her normal puberty. The cause of the impotence
of libido inter coitum in these masturbators is rather the increase
of the excitability of the clitoris at the expense of the vaginal
mucous membrane and of the cervix uteri, through the long-continued
manual irritation of this organ. The stimulation from
these sources to induce libido is thus decreased, and the excitation
of the glans of the clitoris by the penis alone during coition is
insufficient to induce orgasm.</p>

<p>The immediate causes of the masturbatic practices are generally
bad examples. The practice is first learned from friends
in boarding schools, convents, factories or prisons. Sometimes
it is also prurient curiosity which prudish educators and parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
neglect to satisfy which leads young girls to self-abuse. In congenital
hyperaesthesia the pleasurable titillation may accidentally
be induced in complete ignorance of sexual relations. The following
case is quite instructive in this respect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young lady, twenty-four years of age, consulted the author on
account of her extremely enlarged breasts. She stated that eight years
ago she discovered that by a certain manipulation muliebrium she was
able to experience the highest degree of pleasure. For the last eight
years until very recently she continued to enjoy the fruits of her discovery.
She often wished to tell her physician about her wonderful discovery
for the benefit of other young women. One day the author’s book,
“Woman,” fell into her hands, and she learned for the first time to her
great amazement and chagrin that what she was doing was nothing else
but autoeroticism.</p></blockquote>

<p>This simple story shows that ignorance is not always innocence,
as some misled parents seem to think. Sometimes ignorance
is just the cause of the early practice of sex activity.</p>

<p><i>Incest.</i>—Another anomaly which must be attributed to
hyperaesthesia sexualis is incest. Incest, as such, has nothing
pathological in its essence. In the early history of human
marriage incest was the rule. It was practised even in historic
times. Abraham was married to his sister, according to the
Bible. Cimon of Athens was also married to his sister. In the
royal house of the Ptolomei it was common for brothers to marry
their sisters to avoid a division of the empire. Cleopatra, the
evil star of Marc Anthony, was married to her brother. But
these few examples were the exceptions, generally, for the last
three thousand years incest has been considered an abomination
in the eyes of God and men. Its practice was constantly inveighed
against by Church and State. It has, therefore, because
of these constant suggestions, become the second nature of man
to abhor such practices. Only an exaggerated sexual desire,
coupled with the absence of understanding for laws and morals,
could nowadays lead to incest in any civilized country. Even in
the crowded tenements where all members of the family of both
sexes live and sleep in one room, incest is still a great rarity, and
when such a case happens, it deeply wounds the feelings of the
entire community. Such incestuous immoral attacks are, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
rule, made by low, brutal men in a state of intoxication or by
those who suffer from weak-mindedness, by epileptics and by
paranoiacs. Hence in every case of incest, we are justified in
assuming that the seducer is suffering from sexual hyperaesthesia.
An asylum and castration may be a more appropriate treatment
for such a patient than the treatment in prison.</p>

<p>The following case came under the author’s observation while
he was house-physician in the Woman’s Hospital of a well-known
European university:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A mother brought her twelve-year-old girl to the skin department
of the general hospital to be treated for a certain rash the child was
suffering from, for some time. The rash was diagnosed there as pityriasis
versicolor, and the child was recommended to go to the Woman’s
Hospital for treatment. At the examination here it was found that
the twelve-year-old child was six months pregnant. Being too small
and delicate, even for her age, to give birth to a full-term child, it was
decided to induce premature labor. Before the operation, the child was
asked for the name of the man who was responsible for her predicament,
and the following was her version of the accident:</p>

<p>One day, while returning from school, she was addressed, on the
street, by a man whom she had never seen before and who asked her
whether she did not know him, her cousin from X. He said that he
was just going to see her parents, his uncle and aunt. On the way he
took her to a candy-store and bought her candy. When leaving the store
he told her that he had forgotten to take along a present for her parents
which he left in his room, and they both went to fetch it. Upon entering
his room, he locked the door and abused her.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the story the indignation of the medical authorities
of the hospital was beyond all description. The police was immediately
notified to hunt for the criminal. A representative from the district
attorney’s office (Untersuchungsrichter) and a detective soon appeared
at the hospital to get more particulars from the child. The officers of
the court seemed to have a much better experience in the examination
of such cases than the doctors, for when they left the child’s room her
story read quite differently.</p>

<p>The girl’s father had a workshop in the business section of the
city, while the family lived in another part. When leaving school in the
afternoon the child used often to visit the father’s shop and take home
the dishes he took along in the morning. One day, while in the shop
with her father, he took her in the back room of the shop and abused
her. Under threat of death these immoral attacks were often repeated
for months afterwards, until one day the unnatural father noticed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
his child conceptavit ab eo. He then made up the story with the
cousin which the child first told the hospital authorities.</p>

<p>The father was arrested, tried, and sentenced to ten years’ hard
labor.</p></blockquote>

<p>This case shows how low the sufferers of hyperaesthesia may
fall. The man was not drunk when he made the repeated attacks
upon his child. The excuse of the defective separation of the
living quarters is also missing, nor does here exist the cause of
“faute de mieux,” as it is sometimes found in widowers living
with their adult daughters in incestuous unions. The man here
had a healthy wife. Hence it is nothing else but a case of sexual
hyperaesthesia pure and simple of a weak-minded individual.</p>

<p>Incest is oftener found in men than in women, yet there
are cases recorded where women were the seducers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Legrand describes the case of a girl, fifteen years of age, who
seduced her brother to all manner actionum voluptificarum in se.</p>

<p>His other case is that of a woman of thirty-six who, although
married, indulged in abusing her brother, a boy of eighteen. The same
woman was otherwise abnormal, suffering from the anomaly known as
exhibitionism, which is seldom found in women, except among the
insane in asylums. She often exposed her breasts from the window to
attract men.</p>

<p>In another case of the same author, a mother, thirty-nine years
of age, practised incest with her own son and ab eo comprehendit.</p>

<p>Tardieu cites a case of a woman whose victim of criminal attack
was no other than her own son, a boy of nine years of age.</p></blockquote>

<small>PARAESTHESIA</small></h3>


<p>Paraesthesia sexualis covers all possible forms of perversion
or perversity of sexual feeling and sexual activity.</p>

<p>Perverse sexual activity with normal feeling and inclination
is present in the anomalies, masochism, sadism, fetichism,
and exhibitionism.</p>

<p><i>Masochism.</i>—One of the most peculiar phenomena in the
perverse vita sexualis is met with in patients with a desire for
unlimited submission to the will of a person of the opposite sex.
This anomaly was named masochism by Krafft-Ebing after
Sacher-Masoch, whose romances have as their particular object
the description of this perversion. Schrenk-Notzing recommends
the name “Algolagnie.” The distinguishing symptom of masochism
is the wish of the patient to suffer pain at the hands
of, and be subjected to force by the beloved person, to be this
person’s complete slave. This mixture of pleasure and pain is
one of the most peculiar and remarkable psycho-sexual anomalies.
Pain, whether real or imaginary, becomes here a source
of pleasure. Whether the subjection is expressed merely in
symbolic acts or whether there is absolute desire to suffer pain
at the hands of the beloved one, is a matter of subordinate importance.
The characteristic of the perversion of masochism is
that pain and submission, which to the normal individual causes
a certain degree and anguish, are in these patients turned into
a source of lust.</p>

<p>The submission to pain or subjugation in itself is in no
wise pathognomonic of masochism. It may not be pathological
at all. Even entire sexual bondage is not, properly taken, pathological,
if it be only the means of obtaining or retaining possession
of the coveted person. It is not perversion, if fear of
losing the companion and the desire to keep him or her always
amiable, content, and inclined to love, are the motives for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
submission. The henpecked man is not a pervert. It is
not abnormality, but cunning if, to satisfy selfish desires, the
person in subjugation performs acts of bondage at the command
of the ruling individual, but in its innermost is rebelling against
this enforced slavery. Sexual bondage becomes pathological only
when in itself the loss of all independent will-power and the
unlimited submission awaken lustful sexual feelings, and this
submission is hence desired. It then represents a pathological
degeneration.</p>

<p>In masochism the motive, underlying the suffering of the
person in question, is the charm afforded by the tyranny in itself.
The acts performed at the command of the ruling person are an
end in themselves. The very acts of tyranny are the immediate
object of gratification, not the concubitus that may be received
as a recompense. The idea of being treated as by a master, of
being completely and unconditionally subjected to the will of the
lover, of being humiliated and abused by him or her; this idea
in itself is colored by lustful feelings.</p>

<p>The masochistic man has a perfect longing for subjection to
any person whatsoever, especially to a woman. He craves to be
dominated, controlled and abused by somebody. He is not fastidious
in his choice. He revels in the thought of subjugation,
without inclination to a particular woman. The following cases
will serve as an illustration of these types of patients.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A man of forty, happily married, father of three children, college-bred
and wealthy, was as a child already often punished for his cruelty
to small animals. He would delight in tearing out the wings and
cutting off the heads of flies. Later when he attended school he found
great pleasure when he could see boys whipped.</p>

<p>At the time of puberty he began to practice flagellation upon himself.
These practices induced ejaculation and orgasm. Towards the end
of this period he began sese stuprare manu but he could not find any
satisfaction except he imagined himself being whipped by a young woman
in nudas nates.</p>

<p>For the last ten years habet meretricem in a luxuriously furnished
apartment whom he visits once a week and whose duty it is to
flog him in nudas nates until the skin is covered with bloody weals.
At this moment ejaculation occurs. Thereupon he dresses and leaves
the woman. He never has any concarnatio cum ea.</p>

<p>A similar case has been described by Pascal. A man forty-five years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
of age was used to visit regularly a priestess of the Venus vulgivaga,
whom he paid ten francs for the following services:</p>

<p>While the windows were darkened, by letting down the blinds, the
girl had to undress him completely. She then bound his feet and hands,
hoodwinked him, and in this helpless condition led him to a lounge
where he remained lying for about half an hour. After this time the
girl loosened his fetters. He then dressed and left her satisfied.</p>

<p>The following case, similar to the author’s first one, is worth recording
for the pronounced masochistic imagery. A young married man
of thirty-five, father of two healthy children, visits regularly once a
month, for the last ten years, fornicem. There he picks out pulcherrimam
puellam to give him a flogging in nudas nates. This procedure
gives him satisfaction. He never has any carnal connection with
the woman. His relation to her is that of the slave to the mistress
whom he would not dare to touch even in his imagination.</p>

<p>During his childhood he had quite remarkable masochistic ideas,
which, however, have never been put into effect by him. As a small boy
he loved to see animals or children whipped. At the time of puberty
he began manu stuprum and during these acts he revelled in his imagination
in scenes of cruel subjugation. He imagined lying on his abdomen,
and a pretty, very strong girl applying a cane or whip upon his
naked back and nates. Post castigationem, puella, induta solum in interula,
ponente in pectore suo pedem nudum, quem vehementissime osculat
et gratias puellæ agit pro castigatione. Nonnunquam imaginabatur
puellam in pectore suo sedere, capite inter puellæ femora ita, ut vulva
tangeret os suum. Tum linguam suam in vaginam intromisit, labia
minora suxit et clitoridem puellæ lambit. Denique anum osculavit.</p></blockquote>

<p>The last action in his fancy is symbolical of the highest
degree of humility, which does not shrink back even from the
loathsome and disgusting, but on the contrary, considers it a high
honor and favor to be allowed to approach even this unaesthetic
part of the human anatomy. The anal kiss, for that reason,
played a prominent rôle in the ceremonies of the witches’ vigil.
The anal kiss is well known in fornicibus, frequented by
masochists. In men every masochistic desire is at once recognized
as pathological; in women the dividing line between the normal
and pathological masochistic tendencies is not so easily determined.</p>

<p>It is entirely within the physiological limit that playful
taps and light blows should be taken by the woman for caresses.
“Like the lover’s pinch, which hurts and is desired,” says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Shakespeare. In one of the letters of Abélard to Héloïse, the
teacher writes to his pupil and mistress: “Verbera quandoque
dabat amor, non ira magistralis, quaeque omnium gaudiorum
dulcitudinem superarent.” Subordination to a certain extent is
quite a normal manifestation in the loving woman; with her
it is a physiological phenomenon. It is the subordination of weakness
to strength. A certain amount of subordination depends
upon the woman’s passive rôle in procreation. The aggressor
always controls the subjected in love as in war. The element
of pleasure found in passivism and ideal submission is, therefore,
peculiar to the feminine sex. The custom of unnumbered
generations also has given her an instinctive inclination to
voluntary subordination.</p>

<p>Ideas of submission are, therefore, in the woman normally
connected with the idea of sexual relations. They form the harmonies
of the tone quality of feminine feeling, says Krafft-Ebing.
We women, says Schiller, can only choose between ruling and
serving, but the highest pleasure power affords is but a miserable
substitute if the greater joy of being the slave of a man we love
be denied us. Goethe’s Dorothea says: In time shall the woman
learn to serve in accord with her destiny, for only by serving
she finally gains the reins and the power that is rightly hers in
the household. In fact, intelligent women have scant respect for
slavish men, and exaggerated gallantry is distasteful to them.</p>

<p>A moderate degree of submission to the wishes and the will
of the man she loves is, therefore, characteristic of the feminine
nature and is not abnormal. Many a young woman worships her
husband and wishes nothing better than to kneel before him.
This is done because her husband means for her the whole sex
and his importance to her becomes very great. But in masochism
there exists the desire to be subjected and abused by any
man without any inclination to a particular object of love. A
further pathognomonic symptom of masochism is that, as a rule,
the girl begins to dream of subjugation at a time when she is yet
too young to have any perception of love.</p>

<p>The best examples of female masochism are given in
Krafft-Ebing’s two cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The first case is of a girl, twenty-one years of age. From her
earliest youth she fancied herself being whipped. She simply revelled
in these ideas and had the most intense desire to be severely flogged.
This desire originated at the age of five when a friend of her father
laid her playfully across his knees, pretending to whip her. Since then
she had longed for the opportunity of being whipped. To her great
regret her wish had never been realized. She imagined herself absolutely
helpless and fettered. The mere mention of the word cane or
whip caused her intense excitement.</p>

<p>For the last two years she associated these masochistic ideas with
the male sex. Previously she only thought of a severe school-mistress
or simply a hand. Now she wishes to be the slave of a man she loved.
She would kiss his feet, if he would only whip her. She imagines herself
lying before the man of her fancy; he puts one foot on her neck,
while she kisses the other. In the meantime she revels in the idea of
being whipped by him. She takes the blows as so many tokens of love.
She fancies him first as being extremely kind and tender and then, in
excess of his love, he beats her. She also fancies that beating her for
love’s sake gives him the highest pleasure. She often dreams that she
is the beloved man’s slave. The patient never understood that these
manifestations were of a sexual nature.</p>

<p>The second case is that of a woman, thirty-five years of age, of a
greatly tainted family. For some years past she had been in the initial
stage of paranoia persecutoria. This sprang from cerebral neurasthenia,
the origin of which was found to be sexual hyperexcitation. Since her
twenty-fourth year she had been given to manu stupro, the result of a
disappointment from a broken engagement. To appease her intense
sexual excitement, she began the practice of manu stuprum and of mental
erethism by fancying herself to be in concarnatione.</p>

<p>The story of her youth reads as follows: At the age of six to eight
years she conceived the desire to be whipped. She had never been
whipped nor present when others were thus punished. Hence she cannot
understand how she came to have this strange desire. With the idea
of being whipped she had a feeling of actual delight. She pictured in
her fancy how fine it would be to be whipped by one of her female
friends. She never had any thought of being whipped by a man. She
revelled in the idea only and never attempted any actual realization of
her fancies, which disappeared after her tenth year of age.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we have a young masochist whose ideas of humiliation
are associated with her own sex. The reason for the patient’s
fancy for female friends lay in the fact that the masochistic desire
was present in the mind of the child before the psychic vita
sexualis had developed and the instinct for the male awakened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Had the desire lasted until puberty the association of these ideas
with the male would have been established.</p>

<p>The ideas of humiliation of the masochistic sufferers are
in the beginning often associated with their own sex. Not that
they are in any way homosexual at the same time, but because
genuine, complete masochism, being a hereditary taint, the feverish
longing for submission begins in early youth at a time when
the child is as yet unconscious of the difference of sex.</p>

<p>Sometimes the masochistic tendency is not fully developed.
The desire to suffer pain at the hands of the lover has only the
end in view to increase the natural libido in congressu.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the author’s patients, a sexually hyperaesthetic woman of
thirty years of age, who always had a supply of lovers besides her
husband, found great delight in jacendo nuda in genibus amati et ab
eo verberata in nudis natibus. When first told about this peculiar
desire, the author attributed this desire to her natural
hyperexcitation. In this state every impression, produced by the consort,
independently of the manner of its production, is per se attended
with lustful pleasure. But later on, when he learned that she found
more satisfaction in concubitu if preceded by such a spanking, and
that the husband often had to gratify her in this manner even in the
middle of the night, there was no doubt that hers was a case of a
psychical anomaly in which the sexual instinct was partly made insensible
to the normal charms of the consort. Her perverse desire was,
therefore, of a masochistic nature.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the same masochistic nature was the frigidity of the
Duchess Leonore Gonzaza of Mantua. Aloisia Sigea says that
her frigidity could only be removed by a flagelation by her
mother ante coitum: “Virgis Leonora, parentis suae manu ad
hanc diem nullam ex Venere ceperat voluptatem. Hoc vero temporis
momento vehementissime mota est, lacessiti iterum verberibus
lumbi, clunes et femora ad venerem incensi.”</p>

<p>Generally, female masochistic patients are unconscious of
the abnormality of their desires and never come to the physician’s
office. Their pathological condition is only accidentally discovered,
when complicated with other anomalies.</p>

<p>It may be also noted that the courts of justice never or very
rarely have any dealings with cases of masochism, whether in men
or in women, as may happen in sadism. The patient will never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
go so far in his or her perverse desire for suffering that the injury
inflicted may become criminal. For the extreme consequences of
masochism, such as murder and serious injury, as sometimes
found in sadism, are avoided through the instinct of self-preservation.</p>

<p><i>Sadism.</i>—While masochism is a pathological growth of
specifically feminine mental elements, where the patient finds
delight in suffering pain, in sadism the patient seeks lustful excitement
in inflicting pain. Sadism hence represents a pathological
intensification of the masculine mental character. Sadism
is so-called after the Marquis de Sade, who during the French
Revolution devoted himself to the writing of obscene books which
had lust and cruelty for their theme.</p>

<p>Sadism is characterized by the impulse to cruel and violent
treatment of the opposite sex and the coloring of the idea of
such acts with lustful feelings.<a id="FNanchor_BB_54" href="#Footnote_BB_54" class="fnanchor">BB</a> It is hence a non-feminine trait
and is less frequently found in women than in men. Woman’s
modesty causes her to keep herself on the defensive until the
moment of surrender, while under normal conditions man meets
with obstacles in his wooing which it is his part to surmount.
He is aggressive, and aggressiveness is closely related to the infliction
of pain. It affords men great pleasure to win and conquer
women. Nature has given the man for that purpose
strength and combativeness. In sadism this aggressiveness is intensified
and excessively developed. The patient is dominated
by the wish to subdue the object of his desire with cruelty.</p>

<p>Bain explains this love of inflicting cruelty as springing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
from the pleasure the individual finds in the knowledge of the
power and domination it has over the maltreated mate.</p>

<p>The need of the subjugation of the consort forms a constituent
symptom in sadism and may be intensified to such a
degree that the patient will not shrink even from murder.
Sadism is hence mostly found in men, although in rare instances
it also affects women.</p>

<p>The anomaly of sadism shows different degrees of intensity.
The first degree represents Platonic sadism. The patient does
not go any further in his abnormal desires than to commit violent
acts in his phantasy only or to draw and paint scenes of
violence or to describe such scenes in verse or prose.</p>

<p>In the second degree the patient seeks to satisfy his abnormal
impulse by striking light blows, or by biting and pricking different
parts of the mate’s body.</p>

<p>In the third degree of sadism serious wounds are inflicted
upon the mate. The patient does not shrink back from mutilating
the body of his victim or from committing murder.</p>

<p>The fourth degree shows the most abnormal enormities of
cruelty, such as emboweling the victim or the ablation of its
genitals, evisceration, dismembering the victim, sucking its blood
or devouring its flesh.</p>

<p>Cases of Platonic sadism are very frequently met with in
all classes of society. But since the patients do nobody any harm,
such cases never come to the notice of the judge or even of the
physician, and are hence never recorded. They are discovered
in the course of the anamnesis, at the examination for some
other anomaly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the author’s patients who was suffering from psychic impotence,
a talented painter, in his leisure hours, while sitting in the
beer-garden or while conversing with his friends, used to draw on pieces
of paper horrible scenes of war and murder, of wounds and blood. When
asked about this peculiarity, he confessed that in his imagination he
spanks, whips and lashes women until they bleed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sadistic acts of the second degree sometimes come to the
notice of the physician, when he is called upon to treat the wounds
inflicted by the patients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The author was once called upon by a young bride to be treated
for a wound in her left breast which was inflicted through the bite of
her husband in the bridal bed, at the acme of his orgasm. It took
several weeks to cure this love-bite.</p></blockquote>

<p>All such acts of the two first degrees still stand on the
border-line of the normal and pathological. The acts of the
last two degrees are, as a rule, only found in psychopathic degenerates.
The best example of sadistic acts of the third degree
is found in a recent celebrated murder case in New York city.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient has been twice tried for murder and has been sent to
an asylum for the criminal insane. Playing the rôle of a theatrical
agent, the patient used to lure young girls to his apartment by advertisement
and then gratify his abnormal desires by subjecting the innocent
girls to flagellation. He would sometimes have eight to ten girls
in the dining-room of his boarding house and would beat one with a
whip. The landlady saw poor young girls all welts and bruises from
these cruel whippings. On one occasion, she found a girl of fifteen years
of age in his room, whose clothing was torn and arms cut from the
maltreatment. The wealthy degenerate then paid these girls hush-money
to keep quiet. All these facts are in the records of the Supreme
court where a habeas corpus order was argued.</p></blockquote>

<p>An example of the fourth degree of sadism is the celebrated
case of Nathan Schwartz.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On July 6, 1912, the patient, a former prize-fighter, twenty-three
years of age, accidentally meets with a girl, only twelve years of age,
but unusually well developed. He accosts the child and lures her to
his father’s flat. There he chokes her to insensibility, undresses her,
except to her union suit, and carries her to the roof of the house and
hence down to the bathroom of a vacant flat. There he makes twenty
jabs in her back with a knife, slashes her throat and forearms and stabs
her in the heart. The union suit had forty-one rents, all made by his
knife. He then puts her into a soap box where she was found by the
police. Twelve days later the patient committed suicide, while the police
was still looking for him.</p></blockquote>

<p>This case may throw some light upon the brutality of the
prize-fight. The study of the psychology of the votaries of this
brutal sport may lead to some important discoveries. Some
sadistic trait may be discovered in every one of these fighters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
showing that it was not their profession that made them brutal,
but that on account of an innate cruelty, they chose the cruel
profession.</p>

<p>Another example of the fourth degree of sadism is the case
reported by Boas (Archiv f. krimin. Anthropologie und Kriminalistik,
v. 35, p. 195).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A nine-year-old girl is lured by a shoemaker into a cellar. There
the patient abuses and kills the child by choking her with a pillow.
The murderer thereupon thrusts a cane into the child’s vagina, which
perforates the posterior vaginal wall and penetrates into the bowels.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such extreme cases of cruelty as the last two are never
found in sadistic women, at least none are on record. The
woman playing the passive rôle can naturally have no use for a
dead mate. She needs an active live one. Hence only the first
three degrees are found in women.</p>

<p>Moraglia claims that some women’s features manifest
cruelty during conjugation. At the beginning of the orgasm the
face becomes distorted, and by showing her teeth such a woman
assumes a certain ferocity of expression that is sometimes frightening.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the author’s patients, a woman of twenty-six years of age,
mother of two children, would take on a cruel look at the height of her
sexual excitement immediately before the orgasm. This frightened the
husband so that he sought medical advice. She would also grasp with
her teeth her consort’s lips and tongue and bite them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Slight sadistic features are, therefore, not uncommon in
women. Especially in modern times, with the increasing effemination
of men and the corresponding masculination of women,
the aggressive woman is not so great a rarity. The biting and
scratching of the companion during sexual excitement is, therefore,
not uncommon and falls yet within physiological limits.
But when the individual is driven to whip, pinch and prick the
body, or, particularly the genitals of her companion, in the blind
impulse to satisfy sexual desire, such expression of gratification
does not correspond with the natural purposes, and the acts become
perverse. Such uncontrollable emotions may even lead
the individual to homicidal thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<p>Phylogenetically it is significant that sadism is found even
among the lower female animals. At the time of sexual union,
crabs tear off limbs from the bodies of their consorts. Spiders
often bite off the heads of their mates. It is the male spider
who impregnates the female at the risk of his life, and sometimes
perishes in the attempt. It is the male bee that after conjugium
with the queen falls dead from the fatal embrace, leaving her to
fling aside his entrails and calmly pursue her course. Sadism
may, hence, be considered a kind of atavism. It shows man to
be, as Schopenhauer puts it, in reality a wild, cruel animal. We
only see him in a tame state, which we call civilization.</p>

<p>In history it is known that not only the degenerated Caesars,
like Nero or Tiberius, took great pleasure and delight in having
youths and maidens slaughtered before their eyes, but the same
is also reported of women, who did not shrink from committing
sadistic acts. Valeria Messalina and Catherine de Medici found
great pleasure in having the ladies of their courts whipped before
their eyes. Branton relates that Catherine loved to whip with
rods the prettiest ladies of her court only to satisfy her lust.</p>

<p>Among the cases reported in recent medical literature the
case of Krafft-Ebing is remarkable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This author saw a man with numerous scars and cuts on his arm.
Every time, the man explained, he wished to approach his young wife he
first had to make a cut in his arm. She would then suck the wound
and during this act become violently excited sexually.</p>

<p>Blumroder saw a man bitten in the breast by his consort during
conjugation in the great sexual excitement at the acme of libido.</p>

<p>One of the author’s patients, a lady of good social standing, thirty
years of age, took great delight, while sitting on her consort’s lap, in
biting the lobes of his ears or his arms, until he screamed with pain.
He always carried marks of her teeth on his body. Post initum the
face of this otherwise pretty woman became distorted. She lay for
some time with open mouth, showing her teeth, and her face assuming an
ironical, cruel expression.</p>

<p>In Moll’s case absolute frigidity is combined with sadism. The
woman, twenty-six years of age, has been married for eight years
and has one child. She presents signs of hysteria and neurasthenia.
She never had any desire congressionis and until her marriage remained
ignorant of any knowledge of sexual matters. Initus to her
is not only no pleasure but on the contrary a distasteful act, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
the repugnance of it has constantly increased. She can not conceive
how the lumbus can have anything to do with love. She loves her
husband and finds decided pleasure in kissing him. But while kissing
him she experiences great lust when allowed to bite him. She would
find the greatest pleasure if she could so bite him that his blood would
flow. She was better satisfied, if instead of having commixtio she was
bitten by her husband and allowed to bite him. When her biting caused
her husband too much pain she regretted the act.</p>

<p>A few years ago the author treated a patient, a French lady of
thirty-five years of age, who had normal genital organs and was otherwise
well, except that she was laid up in a hospital in Paris for eight
weeks with rheumatism. She found great delight in having her consort
sugere et osculare mammas. She always requested him to continue
this practice for a considerable length of time. At the height of
the orgasm in complexu venereo, her face becomes distorted by ferocity,
taking on a cruel look and showing her teeth. At the same
time she has spasms of the muscles of the back, by which the entire
body is bent backwards, the spinal column forming a convex arc at the
anterior aspect, the veritable opisthotonus often seen in grand hysteria.
After the paroxysm she invariably tries to choke her consort, but desists
from her intent before she has done any real harm or having caused
him any real pain.</p>

<p>Hausler reports the case of a pregnant woman who had a great
desire for her husband’s blood. Several times, while he was asleep, she
stabbed him and sucked his blood.</p>

<p>In Kiernan’s case the patient would hack herself all over her body
with any instrument she could conveniently lay her hands on, not for
suicidal purposes, but because she experienced a fascinating pleasure
whenever she drew blood.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a case of pleasure in cruelty, directed against the
patient’s own person.</p>

<p><i>Fetichism.</i>—The word fetichism denotes the condition in
which an object by virtue of association with sentiment, personality,
or ideas exerts a charm. Erotic fetichism makes an
idol of physical or mental qualities of an individual of the other
sex or even of objects used by this individual. Erotic fetichism
is physiologic in nature. Hence pathologic fetichism is generally,
like masochism and sadism, not so easily diagnosed.
Sometimes it is almost impossible to define sharply the beginning
of the perversion. Fetichism of a considerable high degree is
found in normal love as well. The preference for some particular
physical or psychical characteristic in a person of the op<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>posite
sex is not pathological. The breasts and hips of a woman
are not seldom made the object of a fetich, still this fact does
not denote pathological fetichism. One man may be charmed
by the sweet voice of his beloved, another man is raving over
her soft blond hair. Some man is enchanted by the delicate
white arm, another is enraptured at the sight of her dainty foot,
or is fascinated by the fairy-like nimble gait of his girl and sobs
out of excitement when inhaling the sweet odor of her hair.
Many a girl becomes extremely excited when kissed by mustached
and bearded lips, while a smooth face leaves her cold. Another
girl is thrilled when looking into the serious, thoughtful eyes of
a man.</p>

<p>Hence the enthusiasm extended to certain portions of the
body or to articles of attire, still lies within the limits of
physiological fetichism, if the awakened powerful emotions are
associated with a certain beloved person. When the royal singer
in the Bible (Solomon’s Song, chap. 4) extols the dove’s eyes
of his bride and praises her comely speech, when he compares
her hair to a flock of goats, her teeth to a flock of shorn sheep,
her lips to a thread of scarlet, her temples to a piece of pomegranate,
her neck to the tower of David, and her two breasts
to two young twin roes; when he tells us that milk and honey
lie under her tongue and that the smell of her garment is like
the smell of the Lebanon, no one would declare him for that
reason a degenerate fetichist. The sweet, red, coral-like, quivering,
laughing lips of the mother of the human race have been
extolled in verse and prose since the dawn of history.</p>

<p>Hence if certain parts of the body of a certain person or
certain pieces of its clothing are worshipped because they arouse
strong sexual emotions, this fact, as such, does not prove pathological
fetichism. It may still be normal. But with the normal
individual the main attraction is after all the man or the woman
themselves with their respectively primary and secondary characteristics.
Every part of the body excites and even the clothes
that may cover the part. But there must be a personality behind
these clothes or such parts. When, however, the stimulation
emanating from these parts or their coverings is entirely independent
from the personality, when the fetichist abstracts the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
part from the whole or the clothing from the wearer, then such
emotions become pathological.</p>

<p>In pathological fetichism the creation of lust is effected
through a certain part of the body or through a certain piece
of clothing of the other sex without any reference to any personality.
The fetich creates tumescence which may lead to the
desire of effecting detumescence either concarnatione aut stupro
manu. Not seldom the libido enjoyed by the fetich affords the
patient complete satisfaction and nothing more is sought or desired.
In the latter case the anomaly is complete. The more
the normal desire concubitus recedes, and the fetich becomes the
only aim, the more the fetichistic desire becomes pathological.
This pathological condition, wherein some part or physical peculiarity
of the person or a part of its attire is the object of
erotic desire to the exclusion of everything else, is oftener found
in men than in women. Fetichism in men often reaches the
extremes in its pathological aspects. The patient goes sometimes
so far in his fetich-worship of women’s hair as to stealthily
cut off tresses on crowded streets, or his fetich for women’s handkerchiefs
leads him to become a thief.</p>

<p>The following case offers a very good illustration to which
extremes the fetichist may go:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A man of thirty, married, father of two children, gets peculiar
attacks every two to three months which generally last no longer than
three to five days. During this time he has the irresistible impulse se
stuprare while fondling a woman’s handkerchief. His desire for procuring
women’s handkerchiefs is so strong and irresistible that he steals
them whenever opportunity is afforded. In this way he accumulates
hundreds of handkerchiefs during the three to four days of each attack.
After the attack is over he destroys the ill-gotten articles. He is very
unhappy and miserable over this anomaly. He is constantly in fear
that some day he might be caught and thus cause a scandal which will
disgrace his prominent family.</p>

<p>Dühren relates the case of an Englishman who kept up pulchram
puellam for the following purpose: At certain hours of the day she
had to undo her hair so that he could run his hands through them.
This action gave him the highest libido.</p>

<p>In Blinet’s case a young man becomes sexually very excited at the
mere sight of the pretty hand of a woman.</p>

<p>The author once treated a student who, while separated from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
girl, would take along her petticoat with him and would place it under
his pillow when going to bed at night. Otherwise he could not fall
asleep. A few years later he died in a sanitarium from an abscess of the
brain.</p>

<p>A man, thirty-five years of age, married, father of two children,
as a very young boy, saw his governess taking off her shoes and making
a few steps in her stockings. Since then he gets excited at the sight
of women’s stockings. When once in a department store, he saw a
woman in her stockings trying on a new shoe, the excitement caused
ejaculation and orgasm. At puberty he began to practise stuprum manu.
During the practice he always managed to handle a woman’s stocking.
He assured the author that even the stockings in the store windows are
able to excite him sexually.</p>

<p>In another case a young man of twenty-five saw as a child the
servant-girl of the family washing her feet. Since then he gets excited
when he happens to see pretty naked feet of a woman. He has then
the irresistible impulse contrectandi et osculandi eos. He is unable to go
bathing at the seashore; for some fair bather’s feet may provoke in him
the most violent desire to touch and kiss the same. Sometimes he visits
fornices, ubi puellam pulcherrimam pedum eligit who has to take off
her shoes and stockings so that he may fondle and kiss her feet. He
never has any other carnal relations with her.</p></blockquote>

<p>The perversion of fetichism is, like sadism, a rare anomaly
in women. In most cases recorded, the woman, as a rule, makes
a fetich of the entire person, not of one of its parts or of its
clothing. Still there are some cases of fetichism even among
women where the fetich is directed toward articles of attire.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The case of a young woman, twenty-one years of age, came under
the author’s observation wherein the patient, whose lover died several
years previously, kept for years thereafter his drawers under her bed-pillows.
Otherwise she could not find the desired sleep. At times she
experienced great sexual excitement when fondling them.</p>

<p>In Howard’s case of a woman thirty-nine years of age, the patient
stole a pair of trousers of a certain man and by fondling them lovingly
induced orgasm.</p>

<p>Howard relates of another case of a young woman of twenty-seven
years of age, of a good family, who up to the time mentioned had had
undifferentiated sexual feelings. At a summer resort, she met a man
who was very attentive to her in an upright manner. The first evening
she met the man, he unconsciously displayed a portion of the garter
that held up his silk hose. At the time the patient simply noticed the
carelessness of the act and had no other feelings in the matter.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Upon her return to her home, there began for the first time in her
life distinct, clear and culminative erotic dreams. These commenced by
subconscious visualizing of the blue garter. The association of the
garter with the night reveries increased to day ideation. One day the
patient went into a shop to buy a present for a friend and, on the
counter, saw an exact duplicate of her fetich. It was instantly appropriated
and the patient went immediately to her bed-room, where she
gave way to the effect the fetich had upon her. She soon found herself
a victim of fetichistic manu stuprum. This was never practised without
the psychical aid of the garter, and to have the act culminate satisfactorily
she must have a new garter each time, which must be attained
unseen surreptitiously. A garter purchased would have no effect upon
her sexual nerves.</p></blockquote>

<p>The most remarkable cases are those of urolagnic and coprolagnic
fetichism, almost exclusively found in men, of which
Burton says: “Immo nec ipsum amicae stercus foetet.” But
occasionally such cases are also found in women, as proven by
the case reported by Magnan.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, a young girl of eighteen, of good intellectual development,
but of alcoholic heredity, seduced a boy younger than herself ad
stuprandum mutuum. On one occasion, lying on the ground et tollens
vestes petivit eum ut commingeret in eam.</p>

<p>Moraglia relates the case of a beautiful woman, eighteen years
of age, who, married about a year, experienced only very little libido
in initu et præferrebat stuprum manu. She became highly excited by
the odor of fermented urine. So strong was this fetich that when she
passed a street urinal she was often obliged to go aside se stuprare manu.
Once she went for this purpose into the urinal itself and was almost
discovered in the act. On another occasion stuprandum ei manu in
ecclesia. Her perversion caused her much worry because of the
fear of detection. She preferred, when she could, to obtain a bottle
of urine, which must be old and of a man’s, and to shut herself up in
her room, holding the bottle in one hand and repeatedly se stuprare with
the other.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such cases are exceptional in women. As a rule, fetiches
of women do not relate to inanimate objects or to certain parts
of the body, but to the whole individual. In such cases an impulsive
desire complexus venerei with a certain man imperatively
demands gratification.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Magnan’s case the young woman, mother of three children, told
her husband frankly one day that she was in love with a certain other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
man and that she would kill herself if her relations with him were interfered
with. She promised to return to her husband and children after
six months if only permission were given her to live with this man for
this period in order to quench the fire of her passion. As she was then,
husband and children had no place in her heart.</p>

<p>In another case of Magnan’s the patient, a woman twenty-two years
of age, mother of two children, one day met a boy of thirteen, a pupil
of the public school, and immediately fell in love with him. Driven by
an irresistible passion, she put all modesty aside and asked permission
of the boy’s parents conjungendi cum puero. By way of reply, the
family promptly drove her from their house and broke off all relations
with her. The patient then passed her time before the school of her
beloved boy, watching for the opportunity to see him and speak to him.</p></blockquote>

<p>When a sexual preference has reached such a degree of intensity
and power, the condition is of a pathological nature.</p>

<p>While the pathological condition lasts, there is absolute indifference
and even hatred for husband and children, if the
woman happens to be married. She jeopardizes the dignity of
her wife- and motherhood in order to satisfy her desires. The
unmarried girl of the best family elopes with her father’s coachman,
the crown-princess of an important state elopes with the
teacher of her children and sacrifices her future and her family’s
standing and reputation in the quest of gratification of her sexual
impulse. The man exercises over her a fetich-like charm, which
is entirely out of proportion with the normal attraction of sex.
When a cultured woman like the princess Chimay leaves husband
and children, abandons her refined associations, gives up her
exalted position in society, so dear to the feminine heart, and
marries an ignorant gypsy, such an action transcends the limits
of the normal love-charm.</p>

<p>When the fetich takes possession of the patient she generally
becomes sexually frigid toward all other men except the fetich.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Krafft-Ebing records two cases, where there was absolute impotency
of experiencing libido and of voluptas toward the husband, while the
mere touch of the beloved man’s hand produced orgasm, and commixtio
with him the acme of pleasure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such phenomena can only be explained by the fetich-like
charm the lover exercises over the patient. She is not suffering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
from sexual hyperaesthesia, for she is indifferent toward any
other man except her fetich. She is not a libidinous Messalina,
for she is the mistress of one man only, and her intercourse is
strictly monogamic. On the other hand, the irresistibility and
impulsiveness wherewith the patient expresses her desire prove
that she is not attracted by the normal charm that love generally
exerts.</p>

<p><i>Exhibitionism.</i>—The patient suffering from the perversion
of exhibitionism finds sexual satisfaction by exposing virilia aut
muliebria to the sight of persons of the opposite sex. Sometimes
the exposure is preliminary to or associated with stupro
manu.</p>

<p>The impulse of exhibition is, as a rule, sudden and irresistible.
At the sight of an individual of the other sex, the patient
is suddenly seized by the unconquerable desire to expose pudibilia,
even if the patient happens to be in the street or in
a public garden. If the patient tries to oppose the impulse, he
is generally seized with a feeling of anxiety and fear, of oppression
in the chest and with palpitation of the heart.</p>

<p>Ch. Laseque (Union Médicale, 1877, p. 709), who first
named this anomaly “exhibitionism,” remarks that the exhibitionist
finds enough pleasure and satisfaction in this platonic
manifestation and does not look for more direct relations with
the person to whom he shows virilia sua.</p>

<p>The cases of exhibitionism, says Krafft-Ebing, thus far
recorded are exclusively those of men who ostentatiously expose
virilia sua to persons of the opposite sex, and whom in some
instances they even pursue, without, however, becoming aggressive.</p>

<p>The following few cases of male exhibitionism may serve
as illustrations of this strange anomaly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>George Verret (Annales Médico-Psychologiques Séc. 101; 1912, p.
554) reports the case of a physician who, on different occasions, exhibited
virilia sua before women and children. At these exhibitions
mentula remained invariably in a flaccid condition. Sometimes he
stood before the window of his bed-room and exposed his virilia to
young girls who lived in an opposite house, who happened to be at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
window. At other times he exhibited his organs in public and private
gardens. At some occasions he showed virilia sua to his female patients
in his office. The doctor was tried, found guilty and sent away to the
penitentiary for three months.</p>

<p>The following case, observed by the author, is remarkable on account
of the prominence of the patient. One of the most prominent
gynaecologists of a certain city, occupying a chair at the medical school,
after the examination of a young married woman, resolvit bracas et
mentulam protrahens posuit in manibus mulieris.</p>

<p>This sudden exhibition took the young lady so by surprise that she
was completely stunned and could not utter a word. When she came
to the realization what had happened, she gave one scream and left the
room, leaving the professor still standing virilibus expositis in manibus
suis.</p>

<p>Before going home, the young lady immediately called upon the
author, who had sent her to the professor, and told him what had happened.
She was advised not to tell anybody, not even her husband, about
the disagreeable affair until the author had communicated with the professor.
When the latter was called up by telephone, he immediately
hastened to the author’s office and cried and begged the author to exert
his influence with the young lady not to expose him and ruin his entire
career. He excused himself, that being abstinent, the examination of the
beautiful young woman excited him so that he did not know what he
was doing.</p>

<p>The young modest woman who belonged to a very prominent family
was shown that if the affair became public it would raise a public
scandal and would expose her to the jokes and witticisms of the profanum
vulgus, and that her husband in his rage may commit some rash
act which would bring him in collision with the criminal courts. She
then consented to keep the affair secret and forget it.</p>

<p>Another case known to the author is that of a man of forty with
an hereditary taint, who was always nervous since his childhood. He
suffered from enuresis nocturna until after puberty. He began to practise
stuprum manu when he was only eleven years of age. At present he
shows all the signs and symptoms of hystero-neurasthenia. The pupillary
reaction is retarded, there is a fibrillary tremor of his tongue, and when
standing with closed eyes there is a considerable tottering. The knee-reflex
on the left side is more pronounced than on the right. Very often
there is a profuse outbreak of perspiration on the left side of the entire
body, while the right side remains perfectly dry. At certain periods
the patient suffers also from attacks of anxiety and fear.</p>

<p>One evening, while in a public park, the patient let his trousers fall
down, lifted his shirt and exposed his flaccid genitals to several women
and girls. The women seem to have considered the affair a big joke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
and nothing happened to him. But another time se stupravit manu
in the presence of two girls in the hall of a fashionable apartment.
The frightened girls began to scream, the patient was apprehended and
arrested. Through the influence of political friends, the case was
quashed.</p>

<p>Another case known to the author is that of a married man of a
highly tainted family. His father was potator, his mother hysteric, one
sister is epileptic and the other committed suicide. The patient’s two
children seem to be healthy. The patient often suffers from congestions
to his head, headaches and exophthalmus. The knee-reflexes are greatly
exaggerated.</p>

<p>On repeated occasions, the patient exposed virilia in parks
and other public places before women and girls, calling their attention
by whistling. At one occasion he showed virilia to
women on the street through the window of his room. At another
occasion se stupravit manu under the electric arc-light at night where
the women passing on the street could not help seeing him.</p>

<p>Another patient, observed by the author, forty-two years of age,
married, father of two children, modest and respectable, was arrested
one evening for exhibiting virilia sua before girls passing the streets.
He used to hang around girls’ schools, following the girls after
they used to leave school and attracting their attention ad virilia
exposita. At one occasion he ran about in a public park at dusk
virilibus expositis. Once when he saw a young woman standing at the
window of the opposite house, he immediately exposuit virilia et cœpit
se stuprare, standing before his own window so that the young lady
was forced to notice him.</p></blockquote>

<p>The anomaly of exhibition is found almost exclusively in
men. It is exceedingly rare in women. The girl’s education at
home and in school has developed in the woman the sentiment
of modesty and chastity in a degree out of all proportion with
the same sentiment in men. The woman must be entirely insane
before she will expose herself for the sake of lubricity.</p>

<p>For this reason the few cases of genital exhibitionism in
women, thus far recorded, were all cases of general paralysis.
They are found in asylums for the insane where the patient,
during a maniacal excitement, tollens interulam medico præterienti
concubitum proponit. Still in some women the hyperexcitation
of the sexual desire may be of such an intensity that it
will lead to exhibitionism in an otherwise normal individual, as
the following case of Ungewitter shows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, a servant, twenty years of age, quæ præter amatum
suum concumbebat filio matronæ sedecim annos nato sæpissime exponebat
muliebria in the presence of boys, eight to ten years of age. In the
barn or on porches or even in the open field, tollebat vestes et nudam
vulvam pueris monstrabat convertens animos dicendo; “Contemplamini
hunc locum! Ea est vulva mea. Jam crines ibi habeo; venite et tangite
eam!” She never touched the boys nor did she have any carnal relations
with them.</p>

<p>The defendant servant was found guilty of attempted offence against
morality and was sentenced to two months’ penitentiary.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Homosexuality.</i>—The world is governed by certain fixed
laws. This must be admitted even by the mechanistic theory of
life. In sexual matters the law of sexual-homologous development
is almost as binding as the law of gravitation. The cerebral
centre of voluptas corresponds with the sexual glands in the
inverse sense. The normal inclination of the individual is
directed toward the bearer of the glands of the opposite sex.
The male is attracted by the female and vice versa.</p>

<p>Every individual being has to pass through all the grades of
the evolution of animal life. The remote ancestors of the human
race were bisexual. The same bisexuality exists in the embryo,
represented by the Wolffian and Müllarian ducts or the bisexual
“Anlage.” Later in the development, there arises, so to say, a
struggle between the male and female elements. When one
element has been conquered a monosexual being evolves whose
mental inclinations correspond with the sexual glands. The
basis for the yearnings and longings of one sex for the other would
thus be the desire for perfection, for the completion of those sides
of our being which are present in the bisexual “Anlage” or the
“ground-work” of sex, but failed in development, and for this
reason can not be brought to a realization of ourselves. It is, as if
in the accord of our being some tones are kept in suspension and
are only allowed to chime in with the tones of the other half.
Then, and then only, there is a perfect harmony.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, functional retrogression or atavistic
recurrence into the earlier hermaphroditic forms of the animal
kingdom may take place, or traces of the conquered sexuality, at
least so far as the mental characteristics are concerned, may
remain; and it is these that provoke the manifestations of in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>verted
sexuality. Individuals, thus affected, have a sexually
abnormal instinct which is out of harmony with the physical
sex and its rôle in the function of procreation. The man thus
organized feels utter indifference to women, and conversely the
woman to men, but they have a strong preference and pronounced
sexual inclination toward their own sex. The man easily understands
why a woman should love a man but he can not understand
how a man could love a woman. The same is the case
with the homosexual woman. She is at a loss to understand how
a woman could love a man.</p>

<p>The anomaly of homosexuality is as old as history and was,
in fact, oftener found among the ancients than it is nowadays.
Plato, in his Banquet, tries to explain the enigmatical manifestation
of homosexuality in men in the following poetical way:
There is an Aphrodite without an Eros, but there are two goddesses
of that name. The older Aphrodite, being the daughter
of Uranos, and thus called Urania, came into being without a
mother. The younger Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and
Artemis and is called Pandemonia. The Eros of the former is
Eros Uranos, of the latter is Eros Pandemos. Eros Uranos did
not choose a female, but a male, as his companion. Hence, whoever
is inspired with the love of this deity turns to the male sex.</p>

<p>This Platonic explanation takes no notice of the existence
of Lesbian love. His explanation of Lesbianism would have
been that Aphrodite Urania did not choose a male but a female
as her companion, and the woman inspired with the love of this
deity turns to the female sex or Lesbian love. Lesbianism was
as much in vogue in Greece in the days of Plato as paederastia.<a id="FNanchor_BC_55" href="#Footnote_BC_55" class="fnanchor">BC</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>The homosexual feeling is an abnormal, congenital manifestation
of the cerebral part of the vita sexualis. The essential
feature of this manifestation is the want of sexual sensibility
for the opposite sex, even to the extent of being inspired with
horror by it. This disease must not be confounded with vice.
Perversity is not perversion. Sexual acts with the same sex are
no proof of the presence of a real perversion. Homosexuality is
prevalent in boarding-schools and colleges of both sexes, yet very
few or none of these boys or girls are real inverts. Perverse acts
occur when obstacles are in the way of natural sexual satisfaction.
When the obstacles are removed the individuals return to normal
sexual functions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>The perversity of homosexual acts is very common. Even
among domesticated animals it is easy to find evidences of homosexual
attraction in the absence of the other sex.</p>

<p>Male dogs, rams and bulls, when isolated, become restless
and attempt conjugium together. Male monkeys when long kept
away from their females will try conjugium.</p>

<p>Female monkeys behave in a sexual way to each other.</p>

<p>Deville found that female dogs, when isolated, become restless,
and when in the state of sexual excitement attempt conjugium.
The presence of the opposite sex restores at once normal
conditions.</p>

<p>In cows the sexual desire is often directed to the same sex.</p>

<p>Buffon observed that the females of doves or other birds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
when set together would soon begin to have conjugium among
themselves.</p>

<p>Bailly-Maitre, a breeder of great knowledge, wrote to Girard
that the Belgian carrier-pigeons are strange creatures in their
manners. Conjugium between males and still more frequently
between females often occurs at an early age, up to the second
year. Among hens and ducks it has been occasionally observed
by the author that the female assumed male sexual tendencies.</p>

<p>Following the example of their animals, savages are extensively
addicted to homosexuality.</p>

<p>Homosexuality has been found among almost all the American
Indian tribes. In some of these tribes the homosexual practices
are a part of their religious ceremonies. For this purpose,
a strong man is chosen who jugiter manibus stupratur for hours
every day and is also forced to ride horseback in his free time,
until in the course of time virilia are degenerated, and he
becomes entirely effeminate. He is then dressed in female
clothes and made to do feminine work among the women of the
village. This androgynos is then used as homosexual pathicus
at the annual religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>In Bali homosexuality is common among men and women.
The method of gratification adopted among the latter is either
digital or lingual, or else by bringing the parts together (tribadism
proper).</p>

<p>In Zanzibar the negro women, in addition to tribadism and
cunnilingus, sometimes use an ebony or ivory phallus to which
not seldom a kind of glans is appended. Some have a longitudinal
perforation through which warm water can be injected.</p>

<p>In New Zealand native women were found who practised
Lesbianism. Male homosexuality is the custom of the country.</p>

<p>A like state of things was found among the Brazilian tribes.</p>

<p>Eram found homosexuality widely spread among the male
population in the Orient. Tribadism is also most common among
the young girls there.</p>

<p>Historically considered, homosexuality was frequently practised
among the ancients. In Greece, during the period of its
highest ethical as well as intellectual vigor, the homosexual tend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>encies
were not only condoned, but even fostered as a virtue,
especially among the higher classes of society.</p>

<p>Most of the disciples of the great Greek philosophers were
given to homosexual practices. Homosexuality was also very
common among the women of Greece. It was widely spread on
the island of Lesbos, where the celebrated poetess Sappho is
said to have first taught and glorified the practice of tribadism.
“Aiunt turpitudinem quae per os agit fellationis opinor vel irrumationis,
primum a Lesbiis autoribus fuisse profectam,” says
Erasmus. From the prevalence upon the island of Lesbos, homosexuality
among women is called Lesbianism, while sentimental
homosexuality is called Sapphism.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Sappho taught that each sex should restrict
itself to its own sex, and perish in the sterile embrace.
Omitting the homosexual practice which the sensual Greek
poetess could not dispense with, Tolstoy also advocates the extinction
of the human race through abstinence in the “Kreutzer-Sonate.”
Like Tolstoy, the poetess called normal love a weakness
and a shame. Her teachings were followed throughout
Greece and her colonies, especially by the courtesans, meretrices
and dancers at the festivals.</p>

<p>Lucian describes a tribade woman, Megilla, who, living
with her friend Demonassa ut maritus maritaque invitat Leænam
secum pernoctare. It is her wish not to be designated as a
female. She calls Demonassa her wife.</p>

<p>“Μή με καταθήλυνε ἔφη. Μέγιλλος γὰρ ἐγὼ λέγομαι καὶ
γεγήμακα πρόπαλαι ταύτην τὴν Δημώνασσαν καὶ  ἔστιν ἐμὴ γυνὴ.”</p>

<p>Later on homosexuality was taken up in Rome. Especially
during the empire, the homosexual vice flourished in Rome and
in its colonies. Julius Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, Galba, Titus, Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian,
Commodus, and Heliogabalus all practised homosexuality. Philo
Judeus (Opera II, p. 465) says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> “Some of the men had such
esteem for youthful beauty that they desired complete transformation
into females and effected it by castration and amputation
of the penis and by dressing themselves in purple garments.”</p>

<p>According to Ploss those Roman women, who with the abnormally
long clitoris could practise concarnatio among themselves,
were called tribades. The fellatores and cunnilingui of
both sexes were so numerous in Rome that Juvenal could exclaim:
“Oh, noble descendants of the goddess Venus, soon you
will not find enough chaste lips to address to her your prayers.”</p>

<p>Among the Hebrews homosexuality must have been a very
rare occurrence. Possibly because such practices were punished
by death. “Qui dormierit cum masculo coitu femineo, uterque
operatus est nefas morte moriantur” (Levit. XX, 13). The
Bible never mentions these practices to have existed among the
Jews.<a id="FNanchor_BD_56" href="#Footnote_BD_56" class="fnanchor">BD</a> Lesbianism seems to have been entirely unknown.
The Mosaic law is silent about this anomaly. If tribadism were
known at that period it is difficult to assume that the law
would not have forbidden it, as it forbids bestiality among
women (Levit. XX, 15, 16). Still silence of the law is no
proof of the non-existence of the crime, for paragraph 175 of
the German Penal Code punishes paederastia and bestiality but
not tribadism, in a country where there are as many tribade
women as paederastic men.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages paederastia and tribadism were practiced
chiefly in France. Paris, says Sanval, was full of Lesbian
women. The sister of Louis XV., a prioress, practised tribadism
with the young nuns of her convent.</p>

<p>In our days homosexual practices can be found in every
part of the world, and are forbidden by law, as far as men are
concerned, in every civilized country. Concerning women the
criminal code is, as a rule, silent in most countries. The reason
for this defect in the criminal laws may be ascribed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
ignorance of the law-making power of the existence of this
anomaly. The layman generally does not even surmise its
existence. A woman is by nature not aggressive, and the inverted
complexus venereus among women is not so easily detected
as in men. Women’s attachments are considered mere friendships
by outsiders. We are accustomed to much greater familiarity
and intimacy among women than among men. We are,
therefore, less apt to suspect the existence of abnormal passions
among women. On the contrary, such friendships are often
fostered by parents and guardians, such attachments are praised
and commended. They are not in the least degree suspected of
being of a homosexual origin. If two men were to lock themselves
into a bathroom for a certain length of time, it would appear
to us very queer indeed, but we are accustomed to look upon
the same action in women as a matter of course.</p>

<p>For this reason homosexuality among women is very seldom
detected. Even physicians have very rarely opportunity to learn
anything about this anomaly. Entirely normal women are most
reticent regarding the manifestations of their sexual life. It is
hence far more difficult to gain the confidence of sexually perverse
women. Then again, sexual inversion does not render the
woman impotent for copulation, so that she needed a physician’s
advice which some invert male may seek.</p>

<p>There are thus many reasons for the existing ignorance
about homosexuality in women. No outsider suspects the hidden
meaning of an advertisement worded, e. g., “Wanted by a
lady, a lady friend and companion.” Yet ninety per cent of
such advertisements are inserted in the columns of the newspapers
by homosexual women.</p>

<p><i>Homosexual perversity.</i>—Homosexual practices have various
reasons. From the outset we have to differentiate between perversity
and perversion. It is of great importance to have a
clear conception of what constitutes an anomaly. What is abnormal,
says Ellis, does not, of necessity, mean pathological.
Genius and criminality are anomalies, but they are not, for that
matter, diseases. Virchow says that an anomaly may constitute
a disposition to a disease, but it is not always the disease itself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
The study of anomalies, i. e., pathology, is not the same as the
study of diseases, nosology.</p>

<p>In the study of homosexuality we must hence distinguish
between perversity and perversion. In perversity the anomaly is
not congenital. It develops by degrees at a certain age, sometimes
after normal intercourse. It is, furthermore, not permanent
or absolute. Affection may return to normal channels
at any time. Lastly, perversity is not attended by anything that
is irresistible and impulsive, as is the case in perversion.</p>

<p>Homosexual feeling, therefore, means the feeling for the
same sex, not the sexual acts with it. The mere homosexual act
does not constitute a perversion. It may be called a perverted
instinct, for it is directed outside of the limits within which it is
capable of serving its natural purpose; but so is masturbation,
which is never considered a perversion. An untainted boy or girl,
seduced at the beginning of puberty by persons of the same sex to
homosexual practices, may continue them later on for want of
opportunity for normal intercourse with the opposite sex. But
neither the boy nor the girl will become sexually inverted, although
it cannot be denied that there are exceptions to the rule.
It may happen that a boy chooses a girlish-looking boy and
seduces him to homosexual practices, or that a girl selects a
mannish-looking female for her friend and suffers herself ut
constupretur ab ea. This practice may become deeply rooted
in them, and the result may be the incapability of finding
gratification in concarnatione. Yet such cases are exceptions.
Generally, as soon as the extrinsic influences cease, the seduced
individuals return to normal sexual functions.</p>

<p><i>Necessity.</i>—In the majority of cases men and women resort
to the homosexual mode of gratification for “faute de mieux.”
For that reason homosexuality flourishes chiefly in places where
great numbers of males or females are segregated. Among the
peasants and shepherds in Switzerland, who live for months
segregated in the mountains with no opportunity for natural
sex activity, homosexuality is very common.</p>

<p>For the same reason homosexual relationships are very
prevalent in boarding-schools, academies and in convents for
young girls. In the great majority of cases the tender and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
demonstrative attachments between two boys or between two
girls are of a sensual nature, although they seldom arouse the
suspicion of educators or parents.</p>

<p>The boys, as a rule, practise stuprum mutuum, but not
seldom they are also given to “insertio fascini in rectum,” or
the real act of paederastia. The stronger boy generally plays
the active part, the younger boy is the pathicus; or they often
change rôles during the same sitting. Among girls the rule is
that the girl of weak sexual instinct is, in these attachments,
satisfied with kissing and hugging her female friend, and induces
in this way orgasm and even ejaculation. Those girls of
a strong sexual impulse are given to stuprum mutuum and cunnilingus,
and when the clitoris allows it, resort ad imitationem
commixtionis.</p>

<p>Next to boarding-schools and convents, prisons and factories
are hot-beds for the practice of paederastia, respectively lesbianism.
The young men, respectively the young women, form relationships
and satisfy their sexual desires as soon as opportunity
offers. Their passions are exalted and they experience all the
sufferings of jealousy as in normal love.</p>

<p>All such attachments are dissolved as soon as opportunity
for the exercise of normal sexual activity is offered, as the following
case of the author shows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A man thirty years old, healthy, strong, sensual, began se stuprare
early in life, when only twelve years old. At the age of fifteen
he was seduced by a friend ad stuprum mutuum manu. At this occasion
he had his first ejaculation. Since this time he has practised with
his school friends not only stuprum mutuum manu but also paedicatio.
At the age of nineteen he began to associate with puellae publicae and
gave at once up all unnatural practices.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Fear.</i>—Apart from necessity, one of the main causes for
perverted homosexual practices among normal boys is the fear
of venereal infection. In girls is added to the fear of infection
the dread of pregnancy. The majority of such girls eschew men
because they fear the shame and the consequences of an accidental
pregnancy. An unmarried girl in possession of all her
normal sexual desires is, nevertheless, afraid to indulge in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
normal love affairs as male bachelors do. Hence she looks for a
friend of her own sex where no consequences are to be feared.</p>

<p>How the fear of infection by the impure female may be the
cause of the transfer of his affections to individuals of the same
sex shows the following case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young man of twenty-two years of age, strong and healthy, qui
magnum mulierum numerum habebat at his disposal and never showed
any homosexual tendencies, one day contracted a very bad infection of
gonorrhoea, which after a few days became complicated by orchitis and
epididymitis and which took eighteen months to be cured. Since then he
is afraid to go near a woman. It did not take very long before he made
the acquaintance of a homosexual pathicus with whom he is now living
in a bachelor apartment. He assured the author that, he will never touch
a woman again, except he should get married to a healthy, respectable
girl.</p></blockquote>

<p>Female homosexuality is not seldom caused by the fact that
the young girl does not need to fear the opposition of her guardians
when choosing a female friend. The companionship of a
female friend does not arouse the suspicion of the natural guardians,
and the girl is watched less by them. They would never
allow their ward to sleep in one room with a man alone, but
they suspect nothing if she sleeps in the same bed with a female
friend. Thus indulgence with female friends do not offer so
many obstacles and entail no consequences. Many a girl is hence
induced to transfer her attentions to friends of her own sex.</p>

<p><i>Homosexuality out of lust.</i>—Another cause for homosexual
practices among men and women is lust and lechery. There are
individuals whose only aim in life is the satisfaction of their
sexual desires. All their activities aim at this end. They sacrifice
everything to this instinct. After they have tasted all the
varieties congressus normalis, sexual activity with the other
sex becomes stale, and satiety ensues. They then feel the need
for stronger excitements and stimulations of the diseased nerves
and resort to paederastia and lesbianism. The following case
will best illustrate this point:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A man thirty years of age, healthy and strong, began se stuprare
manu when fifteen years of age but soon gave up the practice on account
of the following incident: The beautiful servant girl in the family
one evening surprised him in his practices.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span> “Ita concitata est
aspectu actionis venereæ, ut se jaceret ad grabatum et incitavit
puerum, ut coitum cum ea efficeret. Qua ex die puerum
noctu in lectum secum quotidie deduxit, et ambo indulserunt
excessibus sexualibus exquisitimis, e. g., fellatio, cunnilingus, mamillae
suctus, coitus per anum, etc.” After a number of years the girl left the
house, and he began to associate with venal women and continued the
same practices with the learned priestesses of Venus. By the time he was
thirty years old he had tasted all the salacious practices these women
are able to teach. Thereupon he turned to homosexuality in the houses
for that purpose. There he plays, as a rule, the active part.</p></blockquote>

<p>The overstimulated women who indulge in homosexuality
are chiefly found among the venal class. It is known that
lesbianism is very prevalent among the meretrices of Paris. In
the relation of the prostitute with men, there is no scope for
the exercise of feminine affections and devotions. Hence they
resort for that to their female friends. This reason, given by
Chevalier, for the prevalence of homosexuality among fornicatrices
may hold good in some instances, but in the majority of
cases the choice of a female friend for the indulgence of sexual
pleasures is actuated by lust and entirely devoid of sentiment.
Overstimulation has simply destroyed natural gratification, and
artificial pleasures are sought. The following case of Rosse is
the best proof of this assertion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Rosse’s case a young, unmarried woman conceptavit a sorore
nupta, quæ commisit simulacrum concarnationis cum ea statim post
congressionem cum marito.</p></blockquote>

<p>Overstimulation and lust are also the causes of the homosexual
love affairs observed among women of high society.
Friendships between prominent ladies and obscure chorus or
dancing girls, or between the prominent female painter and her
female model are always suspicious.</p>

<p><i>Homosexuality as a profession.</i>—The lecherous men and
the exclusive ladies often resort to fornices to gratify their
diseased desires. In this way they create a certain demand for
paederasts and lesbians that has to be supplied. The last part
of the army of homosexual individuals is hence recruited from
those who practise homosexuality as a profession and for lucre.
There is not a large city of any importance that does not harbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
such houses filled with males, kept there to satisfy the demand
of homosexual men. One-fourth of all the fornicatrices of Paris
serve as tribadists for the rich women who patronize fornices.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A man, thirty-two years of age, was treated by the author for gonorrhoea.
One day, when wishing to examine the prostate, the author
noticed the gaping nature of the anus. The diameter of the opening
was about half an inch. Asked about the cause of this opening, the
patient confessed that he had just come from a hotel where he served as
a pathicus for a wealthy patron and that he makes his living by going
from one hotel to another and offering himself as pathicus to homosexual
men, who are loathe to visit fornices, populated by males for these
purposes.</p>

<p>Rosse relates the case of a meretrix who, from curiosity,
visited several women who make a specialty of the vice. By way of
experiment, she submitted herself to the lingual and oral manoeuvres of
the performance and had such a violent hystero-cataleptic attack that
she was a long time in recovering from the same.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fiaux, in his report to the municipal council of Paris in
1887, made special mention of such a house in the rue de Chabanais,
where society women and rich demi-mondaines frequented
for the sole purpose of satisfying libidinem cum puellis.</p>

<p>Chevalier says that the kind of meretrices who exploit
women may be met with in all streets and boulevards of Paris,
in the theatres and at balls, at the races and exhibitions of every
kind. The little girls, between the ages of ten and fifteen, who
may be seen selling flowers in the restaurants and cafés of Paris,
are also, to a large extent, in the service of lesbianism.</p>

<p>All these males and females who offer their bodies to homosexual
inverts for hire, are seldom inverts themselves. With
them it is only a vice or a perversity.</p>

<p><i>Homosexual perversion.</i>—The perversion of homosexuality
has, as a rule, the force of a congenital phenomenon and is characterized
by precocity. In normal individuals the sexual instinct,
except induced by seduction, does not manifest itself before
puberty. The sexual life of the individuals afflicted with homosexual
perversion, on the other hand, appears abnormally early
in life. The impulse appears at the tender age of five to eight
years, and ab initio in a perverted form, without having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
brought about from the outside by bad examples or other
influences.</p>

<p>The child shows its anomaly in its tastes, sentiments, and
occupations. The boy avoids the company of other boys. He
shuns their games and plays. He is found playing with dolls,
ribbons, miniature housekeeping, etc., in company with girls.
He is more particular about his dress, in fact, he loves to be
dressed like a girl as long as possible. He likes to occupy himself
with girls’ work, such as knitting, sewing or crochet-work.
The homosexual girl is found in the haunts of boys and competes
with them in their games. She neglects her dress and
assumes and affects boyish manners. She is in pursuit of boys'
sports. She plays with horses, balls and arms. She gives manifestations
of courage and bravado, is noisy and loves vagabondage.</p>

<p>Toward puberty the boy finds his sexual inclinations and impulses
directed toward men, and the girl hers toward women.
The boy feels himself a girl and attracted to men. He forms
passionate attachments to boys and idealizes his friends. When
he has found a manly friend, he is captivated by his strength
and prowess, by his love of adventure, by his courage and by his
manly grace and beauty. The passion finds expression in stupro
mutuo. The girl, on the other hand, forms passionate friendships
with girls, as a rule, older than herself. She idealizes
and deifies the beloved friend, and praises her beauty, grace and
kindness. Her thoughts are full of the beloved one. She sends
her invitations to come and call on her, she writes her poetry,
offers her flowers and presents and is capable of every sacrifice
for her friend’s sake. She delights in the bodily contact with the
beloved friend. This passion finds expression in kissing, close
embraces and in sleeping together in one bed. She experiences
then the powerful feeling of lustful pleasure, which may be so
intense that it suggests magnetic currents through her body.
Alteri super alteram jacenti tactus corporeus delectationis tremorem
inducit. The orgasm is induced quibusdam contrectationibus.</p>

<p>The homosexual pervert suffers from disloyalty and is tortured
by jealousy. Tears, despair and anger are as common
as in normal love if the friend forms any other friendship, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
matter whether with males or females. If the pervert’s love be
unrequited, he or she suffers the greatest pangs. As a rule, the
inverted individuals are fastidious in their choice of friends.
Their inclinations favor a certain type of men or women respectively.
Once the choice is made they act like passionate
lovers. The pervert’s modesty finds expression towards individuals
of the same sex. The boy is embarrassed in company of
young men and likes to show off in their presence, while the
most attractive young women leave him cold and indifferent.
Their presence is simply ignored by him. The perverted girl becomes
shy and confused in the presence of an attractive individual
of her own sex, but shows nothing of shyness and the
engaging air of weakness and dependence which are the unconscious
invitations to them in the presence of men. She feels a
pronounced indifference to men.</p>

<p>The erotic dreams of the male pervert turn around males.
The autoerotic fantasies are all of men and virilia, while normal
individuals in their imagery never think of their lovers'
pudibilia. The lustful dreams of the perverted girl contain
only visions of females, with corresponding situations.
These dreams where only women appear on the scene cause her
great pleasure and sometimes even pollutions. In her day-dreams,
her fancy pictures muliebria of her own sex.</p>

<p>The homosexual man finds delight in contrectando virilia
alterius that is simply incomprehensible to the normal individual.
The value he or she lays in contrectando et conspiciendo
virilia aut muliebria shows at once the diseased condition.
The inverted boy and girl are constantly on the alert for
the opportunity to see nude men, respectively nude women.
They frequent bathing establishments. They find pleasure in
looking at statutes of nude males, respectively females, and are
frequent visitors of museums. The sight of nude men, respectively
women, awakens in them lustful feelings, while in the
presence of nude women the perverted man remains indifferent,
and the same is the case with the invert woman in the presence
of nude men.</p>

<p>The perverted man has a profound longing for female
clothes. He takes the greatest pleasure in the sight of female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
attire. He tries to dress as a woman at every opportunity. He
likes to frequent masquerade balls where he can dress up as a
woman and dance with women. In short, the patient has all
the feelings and longings of a woman. The inverted woman, on
the other hand, likes to imitate male fashions in general attire
and in dressing her hair. It gives her the greatest satisfaction if
she is able to dress herself entirely in men’s attire and disguise
her identity. She further prefers the occupations of men and
loves at every occasion to play a man’s rôle. When at a ball she
likes to dance with women, and when in a hotel, she loves to
discuss politics with men. In short, she feels herself a man.</p>

<p>The inverted creatures seek, find, recognize and love one
another, and often live together ut maritus maritaque. An invert
woman may sometimes enter matrimony with a man, but this
is done either in ignorance of her anomaly or to secure support.
Otherwise a man has no sexual attraction for her. She is totally
impotent of experiencing libido in congressu cum viro, although
the genital glands are, as a rule, normal and their
functions regular.</p>

<p>In some inverts normal marriage is utterly impossible, the
very thought of normal coition arouses disgust and horror. If
the invert woman is forced to normal concarnatio (the invert
male cannot even be forced, he has no erection in the presence
of a woman), the feeling is the same as if she were compelled
to take disgusting food or drink. For days afterwards she is
nervous and miserable, while concubitus with her own sex affords
her pleasure and leaves behind a feeling of comfort. The perverts
are, therefore, thoroughly happy in their perverted feeling.</p>

<p>Modus operandi among male inverts is, in the first
place, stuprum mutuum. The other frequent method is thigh
friction, “membrum fricando inter femora cynedis qui jacet
in tergo, mulieris instar.” Another quite frequent mode is
insertio fascini in os. In the majority of cases paederastia
consists in initus per anum. Juvenal when speaking of the “condylomes
in cynedes” says: “Sed podice laevi caeduntur tumidae,
medico ridente, mariscae.” “Nates sunt semper repulsae cum
manibus.”</p>

<p>Modus operandi among homosexual female inverts is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
apart from stuprum mutuum, threefold. In the majority
of cases it consists of tribadism (from the Greek word
τρίβειν, to rub), namely in a simple contact and “fricatio genitalium
unius versus genitalia alterius,” or as in Moll’s case, “ut
una premeret femur alterius.” The second mode is cunnilingus
and fellatricia, which consists in “lambere lingua genitalia alterius”
and in “fellare clitoridem et labia minora alterius.” The
third mode is clitorism, which is only possible when the clitoris

<p>In such cases commixtio consists in the “introductio auctae
clitoridis in vaginam alterius.” Such cases with enlarged clitoris
are not so very rare even in normal women.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A few years ago the author performed a total vaginal extirpation
on a sexually normal woman whose clitoris in non-erect state measured
three and a half centimeters.</p>

<p>A woman masturbator is known to the author whose clitoris, when
erect, measures three centimeters.</p>

<p>Kiernan reports a case in which a sexual invert possessed a clitoris
which, when erect, measured six and a half centimeters, or two and a
half inches.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Psychical Hermaphrodism.</i>—The homosexual perversion
shows four degrees. In the first degree traces of heterosexual
feeling are yet to be found, but the homosexual instinct predominates.
The characteristic of the so-called psychical hermaphrodism
is the pronounced sexual inclination toward the same
sex besides the periodically present desire for the opposite sex.
The homosexual feeling is of great intensity and permanent,
while the intensity of the heterosexual inclination is of a much
lesser degree, and the feeling is only present at certain times.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young man, thirty-two years of age, was seduced by a boy of
fourteen to stuprum mutuum when he was only eight years old.
In his lascivious dreams he sees only men. When eighteen years old he
fell in love with a beautiful young girl. Initus with her, although successful,
did not afford him the libido he had expected and he stopped
having carnal relations with her. On the other hand, the pleasure experienced
in his relations with men is of great intensity.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The other case, known to the author, is that of a man of thirty.
He is married and has two healthy children. In commixtione conjugæ
he has to call up the mental images of men, otherwise complete
libido is missing. As a small boy, he loved contrectare parvas puellas.
When thirteen years of age he began spontaneously to practise
stuprum manu. At fourteen he was seduced by an urning ad stuprum
manu and to paederastic practices. The embracing and kissing of
homosexual men induces ejaculation and orgasm. His erotic dreams
are partly filled with male, partly with female images.</p>

<p>Another case is that of a young man of twenty-five, who since early
youth had an inclination for boys and liked to sleep with them and
fondle them. At puberty he began to practise paederastia with boys of
his age. His erotic dreams turn exclusively around males. Still he is
also fond of girls. Although he never had any sexual relations with
women, yet when dancing with them or at other occasions, when he
happens to come in bodily contact with them, he frequently has sudden
emissions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among female psychical hermaphrodites are very often
found married women and mothers of children. But while in
their normal sex-activity they are almost impotent of experiencing
libido, the homosexual practice is accompanied with great
intensity of libido.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In one of Krafft-Ebing’s cases the patient, twenty-nine years of
age, came of a nervous family. When eighteen years of age, she had
relations with a young man. After separation from her lover she
se stuprabat manu for some time. She then donned male attire and
became a tutor in a refined family. Her employer’s wife fell in love
with her,<a id="FNanchor_BE_57" href="#Footnote_BE_57" class="fnanchor">BE</a> and she left her position. Some time later she fell ill and was
sent to a hospital. While there she fell passionately in love with female
nurses and patients.</p>

<p>In another case of Krafft-Ebing’s the patient, twenty-six years of
age, is married and has two children. She always inclined more to her
own sex. Complexus venereus with her husband disgusts her. Since the
birth of her second child she gave up this intercourse entirely. When
a pupil in the seminary she was in love with other girls. At times,
however, she was also drawn toward men. But the latter feeling was
only of a transient character. Her desire is to fondle, kiss and embrace
the beloved girl and imitari coitum cum ea.</p>

<p>In Moll’s case the patient is thirty-six years of age. As a child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
she loved to play with boys and girls indiscriminately. She also liked
to play with dolls. She was wholly innocent and had no passionate
friendships, either with boys or girls.</p>

<p>She began to menstruate when thirteen and a half years old. At
that time she began to experience the first sexual excitements. She had
some vague sensations in muliebribus. She never practised manu
stuprum. When sixteen and a half years of age, she was sold by a
woman in fornicem, where she was forced to stay several years, until
she finally succeeded in escaping.</p>

<p>While in this house she associated with another girl, slept with her
and practised mutual cunnilingus, which gave her great delight. Yet she
enjoyed concubitum with some men. She even allowed one man to
practise cunnilingus secum.</p>

<p>After she left the house she went to Berlin and soon succeeded in
finding a girl friend with whom she lived for two years and practised
active cunnilingus. Afterwards she secured another friend whom she
dearly loved because of her manly features.</p>

<p>The cunnilingus that men practised on her gave her satisfaction,
but she experienced the greater delight, “si femina eam lingua lambit.”
Initus no longer gave her satisfaction, nor was she ever satisfied in
dreams. The images in her dreams were sometimes female, at other
times male.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Strict homosexuality.</i>—In the second degree, only homosexuality
is found. The opposite sex causes frigidity and even
horror. In this degree the sexual desires and inclinations are
ab origine only for the same sex. But the inclinations to the
same sex are limited to the “vita sexualis,” while in character
and mentality the patient remains distinctly in conformity with
the sexual glands. The histories of the three following cases
observed by the author will well illustrate this degree of homosexuality:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A young man of thirty-five years began to feel a certain attraction
toward his own sex when only ten years old. At puberty this attraction
developed into the strong desire to have complexus venereus
cum amicis. At the same time there was a pronounced feeling of
indifference and, later on, that of actual repulsion towards women. The
only way to have concarnationem cum mulieribus at all was by Venus
aversa and thinking at the same time of sympathetic men.</p>

<p>The second case is that of a man of thirty-three years of age. As a
boy of seven, he was initiated by an older friend into the mysteries of
stuprum manu. At puberty he found a few friends with whom he often
practised paedicatio. His erotic dreams are of men only, At the mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
sight of a man’s virilia he has orgasm and ejaculation. To procure
himself this enjoyment he frequently visits the seashore and other
bathing places where he can see naked boys and men. Even the statues
of men in museums cause erections. Women have no attraction for him.
Even the most beautiful women do not excite the slightest degree of
desire. No erection in their company takes place, even if they allow
advances and the most intimate sensual titillations.</p>

<p>The following case of a man of thirty years of age shows how maladjustments
of environment may develop a permanent homosexual perversion.
At the age of ten the patient was abused by his tutor for
paederastic purposes. Since then he was not able to give it up.
Concarnatio with sympathetic men gives him the highest pleasure. His
aversion to women is now complete. Before his seduction he had inclinations
to little girls. Nowadays the sight of a naked woman disgusts
him. He loves to be caressed, fondled and adored by men. He likes
to be adored by and feel dependent upon some powerful man. He hires
strong men ad inserendum fascini in anum suum. For this reason he
is often found in the haunts of the worst gangs of the under-world of
the city. He never as yet played the active part, quamquam erectiones
et ejaculationes habet vehementes jacens in brachiis amatorum mercenariorum.</p></blockquote>

<p>Krafft-Ebing relates the histories of several female patients
belonging to this degree of homosexuality.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of his patients was neurasthenic and always excited. From
her earliest youth she was subject to sexual excitement and spontaneously
stuprabat manu. She began to menstruate at the age of
fourteen. Menstruation caused her great pains and was accompanied by
intense sexual excitement. When she was eighteen years old she gave up
manu stuprum. She never experienced inclination toward the opposite
sex and married only to find a home. On the other hand, she was
powerfully attracted by girls and realized that this meant more than
mere friendship. The sight of a pretty girl causes her intense excitement.
She has at once the desire to embrace and kiss her. She dreams
of girls and revels in looking at them.</p>

<p>In another case of Krafft-Ebing’s the patient was twenty-two years
of age and considered a beauty. Though she was very sensual, yet she
refused all proposals of men and only once in her life allowed an admirer
to kiss her.</p>

<p>Until puberty she was sexually indifferent. When seventeen years
of age she happened to see one of her admirers in “actione coeundi,”
“more bestiarum,” cum muliere menstruata in horto. The sight of
the blood and the bestial lust of the man terrified her to such
a degree that she saw henceforth in men only the embodiment of coarseness
and vulgarity. When nineteen years of age she made the acquaint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>ance
of another invert with whom she indulged in wild orgies until she
fell exhausted and unnerved. Cum altera jaceret in se cunnilingum
faciens she felt an unspeakable thrill going through her whole body.
She herself was only allowed to kiss the other’s “mammae.” These relations
with her friend lasted a year.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Effemination and viraginity with psychical perversion only.</i>—In
the third degree of homosexuality, the so-called effemination
or viraginity, where the entire mental existence is altered,
the man of this type resembles in his mental qualities a woman,
“anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa.” But his body is
still that of a perfect man. The woman, on the other hand,
resembles in her mental qualities a man, while her bodily characteristics
remain still feminine. The following few cases may
serve as an illustration:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient is a man of thirty years of age, tall, manly, with
broad shoulders and an abundance of hair of beard and mustache. As a
child, he was disposed to girls’ games. At the time of puberty, he
spontaneously acquired the vitium stupri manu, but always with the
accompaniment of the prurient imagery of males. As far as he can
remember he was always attached to men. He shunned women as he
would a lethal pest. He also abhors paedicatio and fellatio.</p>

<p>He is given to introspection and self-scrutiny. He is retiring in
his manners, is melancholic and often harbors suicidal inclinations. The
expression of shame is toward grown men, not toward girls or women.
Already when a very young boy he was ashamed to undress before a
man. He is very fond of perfumes, likes to powder and paint himself
and to pencil his eye-brows. He is very curious, vain, and loves to
gossip.</p>

<p>The second case of the author is that of a physician, forty years
of age. In his earliest childhood he always played with dolls, associated
with girls only and avoided boys’ games. He was always sickly as a
child. He began stuprum manu when he was eleven years old, seduced
by one of his girl friends. At puberty he gave up stuprum manu and
began to love strong men. He had frequent pollutions with male imagery
which weakened him considerably. At the same time his voluptas grew
stronger. He then tried to associate with meretricious venery but found
himself completely impotent for erection or orgasm. Even the manusturpation
of the puella publica would fail to effect an erection. His desire
is to be in the arms of a strong man. In the homosexual acts he
always plays the passive rôle. He is effeminate in his character, sensitive,
easily moved to tears, and is greatly embarrassed and silent in
men’s company; while among women he feels himself perfectly at home.
He feels himself a perfect woman.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

<p>Viraginity with psychical perversion is as often found among
women as effemination among men. A good many cases of this
kind of viraginity have been reported in the medical literature.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of these cases has been reported by Wise. The woman, fifty-six
years of age, was always peculiar in girlhood. She preferred masculine
sports and labors. She had an aversion to attentions from young
men and sought the society of her own sex. She consented to marry
when twenty years of age, and had one child. When she was deserted
by her husband, she began to follow her predilection for masculine
avocations. She donned male attire and became a trapper and hunter.
She considered herself a man in all that the name applies. After many
reverses she entered an almshouse and here she became attached to a
young woman. When the attachment became mutual, both left the
institution for the woods to commence life instar mariti maritæque. They
lived in this relation until the patient had a maniacal attack that
resulted in her committal to an asylum.</p>

<p>Another case of viraginity has been reported by Kiernan. The
patient, a girl of twenty-two years of age, when a child, liked boys'
games and was fond of male attire. She felt an attachment to some of
her female friends and satisfied voluptatem faciendo stupra mutua
cum amicis. The powerful impulse for sexual gratification came
over her at regular periods. She became intensely excited at the
sight muliebrium. In her lascivious dreams she saw only female pictures.
She also suffered from imperative conceptions.</p>

<p>In Westphal’s case, the patient, thirty-five years of age, was as a
child fond of boys’ games and was anxious to wear male attire. From
her eighth year she felt herself drawn to certain girls. She kissed and
hugged them and sometimes induced them permittere ut muliebria contrectaret.
Between her eighteenth and twenty-fifth year she had frequent
chances contrectandi muliebria. When such chances were wanting, she
satisfied herself stupro manu. Stuprabat sese especially just before
and after menstruation. When she attempted to control herself she experienced
a disagreeable odor and taste, arising from muliebria sua.</p></blockquote>

<p>The cases mentioned by Ellis also belong to this degree of
female homosexuality.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Catherine Tucker nupta erat mulieri et eam comprimebat ope fascini
factitii.</p>

<p>In Memphis, Alice Mitchells planned marriage with Freda Ward.
When the scheme was frustrated by Freda’s sister, Alice killed Freda
by cutting her throat.</p>

<p>In Chicago one of the Tiller sisters was an invert and lived stupre
attached to the other. One day the healthy sister was induced to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
the invert and got married. The deserted sister then broke into the
apartment of the couple and shot the husband.</p>

<p>Another case is that of a trained nurse in Chicago who lived
stupre with a young girl of fourteen years. The latter left her four
times, but was always induced to return again. One day, the girl married,
whereupon the nurse shot the husband.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Effemination and viraginity with bodily perversion.</i>—In
the fourth degree of homosexuality not only are the mental
characteristics peculiarly feminine, respectively masculine, but
the form of the body approaches that of women, respectively of
men. Only the genitals are differentiated and are completely
male or female; otherwise the patient could be considered a
woman, respectively a man. The following case of a male patient
will illustrate this degree of the anomaly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A man of forty had always had homosexual impulses, as far back as
he can remember. His stuprosæ acts were attached by mental images
of men. The autoerotic fantasies are all of men. In his erotic dreams
the images of men accompany the orgasm. The patient feels himself
entirely like a woman and is attracted by physically well built men.
Naked men in life or in sculpture have a great attraction for him.
Women have never made the slightest impression on him. The mere
sight of a naked woman disgusts him. Initus with women always
failed for lack of erection, while homosexual acts afford complete satisfaction.</p>

<p>The patient has a disinclination to masculine pursuits. He does
not drink nor smoke. His habitus is entirely feminine. The body is
slight and non-muscular. The shoulders are narrow, the pelvis broad,
the hands and feet decidedly small. The form is rounded with an abundant
development of adipose tissue. He has few hairs on beard and
mustache. His complexion is fine. His voice is feminine, he speaks in
falsetto voice. His gait is rocking, womanly. He wears his hair quite
long.</p>

<p>Since childhood he was actuated by the desire to put on female
attire. He always wore female undergarments, such as shirts, drawers,
corsets, etc. He generally wears bracelets on his arms. Whenever he
can, he dresses up like a woman and takes long walks upon the streets
in such costumes. Through his love for feminine attire he came in
contact with several transvestites who form a kind of club in this city.
But the latter who abhor homosexual practices soon discovered his
motive for the desire of feminine attire and avoided his company. In
his reveries, dreams and acts the patient always plays the pathicus.
For some reason or other, unknown to the author, the patient committed
suicide.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<p>The female, suffering from the fourth degree of viraginity
with bodily perversion, approaches in the form of her body that
of men. For this reason she may easily masquerade as a man,
associate with men, go through the marriage ceremony with a
homosexual woman of the class suffering from the first three
degrees of homosexuality, and she will never be found out until
she dies. A few cases of this class were described by Krafft-Ebing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient is a talented artist, twenty-five years of age. She has
masculine features, a deep voice, a manly gait and small mammae.
Early in her youth she preferred to play with boys. She never had
a liking for dolls or needlework and found no pleasure in domestic
duties. At fifteen years of age she began to menstruate. At the same
time she began to fall in love with young girls. Her love was only
platonic in nature. She is perfectly indifferent toward men. She is
bashful only toward persons of her own sex. In her lascivious dreams
females are on the scene where she herself plays the man’s rôle.</p>

<p>In another case of the same author, the patient, when a girl, had
inclination for boys’ sports only. Once, when she was allowed to go to a
theatrical performance, dressed as a boy, she was filled with bliss. Until
her marriage, at the age of twenty-one, she was indifferent to men and
women alike. She began to menstruate at the age of eighteen. Her engagement
was a matter of utter indifference to her. Her connubial duties
were first painful and, later on, loathsome to her. She never experienced
sensual pleasure, yet she became the mother of six children. Her husband
began at that time to practise onanism (coitus interruptus). At
the age of thirty-six she had an apoplectic stroke. From this time on
she felt that a great change has taken place in her. She was mortified
at being a woman. Her menstruation ceased. Her feminine features
assumed a masculine expression. Her breasts disappeared. The pelvis
became smaller and narrower, the bones more massive, the skin rougher
and harder. Her voice grew deeper and quite masculine. Her feminine
gait disappeared. She could not wear a veil. Even the odor emanating
from her person changed. She could no longer act the part of a
woman, and assumed more and more the character of a man. She complained
of having strange feelings in her abdomen. She could no longer
feel her muliebria. The vaginal orifice seemed to close and the region
of her genitals seemed to be enlarged. She had the sensation of
possessing a penis and a scrotum. At the same time she began to
show symptoms of the male voluptas.</p>

<p>In another case of Krafft-Ebing the patient, thirty-six years of age,
commenced se stuprare manu at the time of puberty, when thirteen years
old, and became homosexual when sixteen years of age. When twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>-six
years old she had the feeling of transformation. She imagined
muliebria sua turning into the male form and began to urinate like a
man. She does not feel ashamed to undress in the presence of a man,
but is shy to do it in the presence of a woman.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of the fourth degree of homosexuality is
that of Murray Hall, who died in New York City in 1901. Her real
name was Mary Anderson. Born in Scotland, she came to America,
where she lived as a man for thirty years. Her features and her behavior
were so entirely masculine in character that through all these
years her real sex was not even suspected by her closest friends. She
became distinguished as a Tammany politician and as a man about town
who knew how to make money. She associated with politicians, drank
to excess, swore a great deal, smoked and chewed tobacco. She was fond
of pretty girls and liked to associate with them. She entered twice into
matrimonial relations with other inverted women. Her first marriage
ended into separation; the second lasted twenty years and was happy
until the so-called “wife” died. The secret that “Mr.” Hall was really a
woman was not discovered till after her death.</p>

<p>A similar case is that of De Raylan, who was assistant to the
Russian consul in Chicago for twelve years. When he died in December,
1906, it was found that the assistant was a woman. She smoked
constantly and was possessed of a discriminating taste for liquors with
ability to withstand the effects of drink better than most men. She was
married with the present “Mrs. De Raylan” for the last twelve years
after having been married once before and divorced.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Transvestism.</i>—The psycho-sexual anomaly of transvestism
consists in the desire for cross-dressing. The male patient has
the abnormal desire to dress like a woman, and the female patient
longs to dress like a man. It is in this respect akin to the
anomaly of homosexuality. In the degrees of effemination and
viraginity, cross-dressing is a prominent symptom. The homosexual
pathicus has naturally the impulsive desire to dress like
a woman, and vice versa, the Lesbian woman longs to dress like
a man.</p>

<p>Still, cross-dressing is a pathological entity by itself. Homosexuality
is a morbid sex state of gross somatic experiences. It
emanates from the crude, powerful sensation of sex. The individual’s
longings extend to somatic sensations. These desires
often rapidly reach an obsessional state. Transvestism, on the
other hand, is a sexo-esthetic inversion of pure artistic imitation.
Hence it occurs mostly in artists and in men of letters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
i. e., in persons endowed with a highly developed artistic taste.
Such persons are, as a rule, disgusted at the sight of the organs
of the sex to which the individual by anatomical configuration
belongs, while such sights offer to the homosexual individual
additional charm and piquancy.</p>

<p>Transvestism tends to accent the esthetic sensibility. The
patient’s experience of an increased comfort and well-being by
the gratification of the pronounced impulse of cross-dressing,
is more akin to the satisfaction of the artist, experienced by the
successful expression of a certain symbolism. Transvestism
is more in harmony with the basal esthetic demands. The
patient harbors exalted ideas and is striving to secure artistic
enjoyment in the appreciation of the beautiful. The attraction
is in the mind and has nothing to do with the sex-organs. Hence
transvestism seldom celebrates orgies of lascivious and voluptuous
practices, as often found in homosexuality. If sensuous caressing
does take place, it is with a person of the other sex. For
the physical part of the sex activity is perfectly normal.</p>

<p>The following five cases of transvestism in men<a id="FNanchor_BF_58" href="#Footnote_BF_58" class="fnanchor">BF</a> will illustrate
these points:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The first patient was very delicate all the time up to four years of
age. His father died when he was four years old, and the boy was
brought up by his mother. As the youngest living child (Nesthäkchen,
nestling) he was rather spoiled by her. He slept with his mother until
he was fourteen years old. The patient’s looks were rather girlish.
He always wore girl’s shoes, on account of his high instep. Up to twelve
years of age the patient played with girls, made dolls’ dresses, cooked
in girls’ cooking stoves, etc. The patient’s sister was a dress-maker
and often used the patient as a model to drape or to try on dresses.
Otherwise the patient was never seduced by anyone to irregular practices.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="title">CUT XLIII.</div>
<img src="images/i_pg299.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A characteristic picture of patient No. 1; posing in imitation of the
celebrated painting “Psyche in Bath,” dressed in stockinet.</div>
</div>

<p>At puberty a certain change took place in the psyche of the patient.
At this time, when about twelve years of age, he began to think how
nice it would be if he could be changed into a girl. He never had any
sexual desires for women. In stuprando manu he donned female attire,
but his fancies had always women as the objects. When the patient is
dressed like a man, no one would take him for a woman. There are no
strongly pronounced feminine traits. The sex-organs are those of a
normal man. The distribution of the hair on the body is almost the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
same as in any other man. The head is rather bald. On the arms there
is no hair, but the hands are covered with hair. The hands are rather
small, narrow, soft, well-shaped and artistic. The fingers are tapering.
The legs and feet, when in dainty stockings, are rather feminine. The
patient wears woman’s shoes. Otherwise when he is dressed like a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
he looks like a normal man. But when the patient is in stockinet as in
his photograph, “Psyche in Bath,” no one would take him for a man.
When dressed like a woman, nobody would recognize a man in him. He
has taken walks on streets unnoticed while so dressed. He never drew
any attention, so perfectly does he look like a woman.</p>

<p>The patient’s behavior is quiet but not effeminate. His voice is
low, of uncertain timbre. He tries to cultivate a female voice without
resorting to falsetto. His writing is uneven, sometimes bold; mostly,
however, it is a woman’s small handwriting. The gait is like that of a
woman, swaying in the hips. The patient suffers from periodical hemorrhages
of the nose, which he is inclined to consider as a kind of
vicarious menstruation.</p>

<p>As far as the emotions are concerned there is a marked feminine
sensibility. Tears come easily when watching emotional scenes. He
smiles almost constantly when in conversation, but he rarely laughs outright.
He is very sensitive to pain, but stoic enough not to complain.
He blushes on the slightest pretext. He is possessed of feminine adaptability.
He likes needlework and loves to do crochetting. He likes female
amusements, such as “Kaffeeklatsch.” He is a freethinker in his creed.</p>

<p>The patient possesses normal love and admiration for the other
sex. He is attracted by women, although his sexual feelings are very
little pronounced. He takes the greatest pleasure in contemplating pictures
of the female form. His day-dreams and fancies are only of
women. He has no homosexual inclinations, but rather a profound
repugnance against homosexual relationship. He never longed for a
male instead of a female lover. Still he seems to want a man before
whom he could expose the charms of his own person and who would kiss
and caress him. His sexual desires are not developed. He never was
in love with any women or men. His wife proposed to him. He may
have remained otherwise single. He has three children, all perfectly
healthy.</p>

<p>The peculiar anomaly the patient is suffering from is the desire
to be a complete woman. From his childhood he had the wish to be a
girl. His desire now is to live as a woman absolutely. He never had
any dream where he saw himself as a woman; in fact, he never had
any erotic dreams. He longs for the female form. He often wished to
be castrated to be more like a woman.</p>

<p>The patient is attracted by beautiful women, but the instinctive
feeling toward them is not the desire for possession, but more a feeling
of envy that he cannot be one like them. The appeal of woman’s beauty
to him is connected with the desire of inner or psychical or subjective
identification of himself with the beautiful woman, the desire to be in
her place—“Einfühlung, Miterleben,” as the Germans call it. He would
do almost anything to see a girl in any condition of exposure, but he
would experience only the desire of inner imitation. His desire to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
himself in female attire is founded upon the impulse of being considered
a full woman.</p>

<div class="caption">First patient.</div>
</div>

<p>From a legal point of view the patient’s inversion is mainly confined
to the sphere of clothing. He has a profound longing for female
clothes. He takes pleasure in the sight of female attire. Woman’s
underclothing exercise a greater charm upon him than the woman herself.
He especially attaches great importance to the corset. The patient
is always dressed in female underclothes. He wears only a man’s coat,
vest and trousers, or the clothes belonging to the outward cover. He
wears woman’s shoes, shirtwaists, corsets, stockings, etc. The earlobes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
are pierced for earings, which he wears every night. He takes breakfast
dressed as a woman.</p>

<p>When the patient is dressed as a woman, he has all a woman’s
feelings and longings. For this reason he tries to dress as a woman at
every opportunity. The desire to be dressed like a woman takes the
form of an imperative impulse. When he cannot dress up he becomes
restless. He would rather commit suicide than be without female
apparel.</p>

<p>As a literary man and brain-worker, the patient can concentrate
his thoughts better when in female attire. When dressed as a woman
he feels himself to be in a normal condition and is cheerful. A feeling
of absolute comfort and restfulness comes over him, when in female
clothes, and his behavior is in full accordance with his feelings, while
in male dress there is a kind of absent-mindedness about him; he is
always thinking of his female dresses.</p>

<p>The second case is that of a gentleman of about sixty-two years of
age living in the western part of our country. As a child he was
known as mother’s boy, and his mother and he were very fond of each
other. He has always done his best to please her, spent as much of his time
with her as possible, and took great pleasure in the tasks she would give
him, such as knitting, crochet work, or plain sewing. On most of all
these occasions she would first put him in girl’s clothes. The hardest
tasks would then be a pleasure to him. These practices continued up
to his twelfth year of age.</p>

<p>From his earliest recollections his playmates were always girls and
his playthings were dolls, ribbons, miniature housekeeping, furniture,
etc. He was an expert doll maker and could cut and make doll clothes
for his sisters and other little girls. At ten years of age he could cook
and prepare a meal. He was known to have no lack of courage.</p>

<p>His inclinations are always towards strong-minded, energetic
women of the masculine type. He also has an admiration for other men
of his type when they are dressed like women. He never had any homosexual
inclination. He always had an almost uncontrollable desire to
wear woman’s attire. When so dressed he can always think more logically,
feel less encumbered, solve difficult problems. But for the popular
prejudices he would always wear female attire.</p>

<p>The skin of the patient is soft and clear, the hair on head and
beard is soft and light. He has little hair on his body. His shoulders
are square and his breasts quite large. His voice is high.</p>

<p>He blushes readily. He could never countenance vulgarity, such as
smutty stories or obscene remarks. He is receptive. He is very sensitive
to pain or pleasure. He is inclined to be stubborn. His intellect
is keen, and he thinks logically.</p>

<p>When about fifteen years old his father forbade him to wear female
clothes, so he kissed his mother good-bye and made his way to the far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
West. There he drove a team on construction work of a railroad and
in the fall of the same year found himself hunting buffalo. In the five
ensuing years he has done his part in winning of the West, with the
result that he carries two Indian bullets in his legs. But he covers them
up with petticoats, he says, as often as opportunity permits. Then he
forgets all about them, as well as all other troubles. He has served as
a detective in a United States marshal’s office, as a sheriff, and as a
justice of the peace. He has been able to conquer almost everything
except his uncontrollable passion for female attire. When the inclination
to dress comes over him, he is unable, try as he may, to resist it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This last characteristic in the case shows that the desire
for cross-dressing may often assume the degree of a veritable
imperative idea. If the desire is not satisfied, some patients are
seized with anxiety, accompanied by cold perspiration and palpitation
of the heart.</p>

<p>The third case is of a gentleman, thirty-two years of age,
married. In his answer to a letter written by another transvestite
asking him for his life history, the patient writes that
he expected the letter, because Agnes M. had told him that he
would receive one. This Agnes M. was a man, and it is characteristic
of these patients to call each other by girls’ names. Our
patient, too, signs his name, “Yours femininely, Blanche.” The
part of the history of this “Blanche” that interests us most
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The feminine instincts first appeared at the age of four years.
He was then attending a small girls’ school in the country, his mother
having a business in town. At about that age, it was suggested that
it was time that he was put into knickers. When he first was dressed in
boy’s dress, a horrid feeling assailed him. He fought so persistently
against wearing these new apparel that his mother resolved to leave
him dressed in girl’s attire for a few years longer. Thus he was able to
wear frocks for the first eighteen years of his life.</p>

<p>At that time necessity made it imperative for him to earn a living,
and he was forced to go out into the world dressed as a boy. He writes,
he will never forget the great aversion which assailed him when he first
went out in trousers. He seemed ashamed to look anyone in the face.
He always wanted to hide his legs.</p>

<p>He never gave up feminine underwear, only outwardly he dresses as
a man. In the house, when he returns from business, he always dresses
as a woman. His mind is never contented during the daytime. When
the evening comes, the first job on getting home is to don a petticoat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
and frock and to be for the rest of the evening in the garb which his
mind tells him is the right one. He feels nothing but nausea in the
garb of a man.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="title">CUT XLV.</div>
<img src="images/i_pg304.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Third patient.</div>
</div>

<p>The last characteristic shows plainly the morbidity of the
case. A normal woman, if forced by circumstances to wear
men’s clothes, may have the feeling of being improperly dressed,
but she would not have the feeling of nausea. Here we have
a creature with a normal male body, but on account of the complete
female mind he feels nauseated when wearing male clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>The fourth case is that of “Prof.” M., a female impersonator,
who also addresses his transvestite friends by girls’ names. His
history reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient is sixty-two years of age, has a beautiful form, small
hands and feet and a beautiful head of hair which he can do up in lady’s
fashion by the aid of switches.</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="title">CUT XLVI.</div>
<img src="images/i_pg305.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fourth patient, dressed for the street.</div>
</div>

<p>His mother dressed him in girls’ clothes until he became a large-sized
boy, and when she attempted to put him into boys’ clothes, he
would kick and scream. Since that time, when opportunity presented
itself, he would masquerade in female garb. There seems to be a
peculiar fascination and pleasure to him when dressed in the clothes
of the opposite sex. A sort of an irresistible impulse comes over him
at times, and he cannot extricate himself. He can control his thoughts
better, write and seemingly work better when dressed in skirts, and he is
more contented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>


<p>His sexual organs are fully developed and do not differ from any
other male organs. A number of years previously he was strong sexually
and fond of the opposite sex. Nowadays he cares more for his
own sex. Men look more attractive to him than women do. “It seems
strange,” writes the patient, “but I think all female impersonators learn
to have an abhorrence for the female sex, even a hatred in the course
of time.” “Dear Miss S., as you and Maude (by the way, S. and Maude
are both men) are in the same boat, I am free to tell all these things.
I am pleased to find one who thinks as I do. The common herd does
not understand me.”<a id="FNanchor_BG_59" href="#Footnote_BG_59" class="fnanchor">BG</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This case throws a certain light upon the psyche of the
woman impersonators. They do not become effeminate through
the long habit of masquerading—that would be confounding
cause and effect—but their innate anomaly leads them to choose
impersonating as a profession. A normal man would hardly
select such a profession as his life work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>The following case is that of a gentleman, aged thirty-six
years, an artist painter who is about to marry. In his letter to
a transvestite friend he protests against the insinuation of homosexualism.
He writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The reason why I did not answer before is because it seems to me
that our views on the matter mentioned are very diverging. As far
as I can judge from your letter, it looks as if you consider man’s love
for dressing in female clothes equal to homosexualism. I can tell you
that homosexualism has always been an abhorrence to me, and that the
sole reason for my desire to wear gowns is purely feminine love for
what is beautiful and picturesque. In my relations to the other sex,
I am just as normal as any other man.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The longings for cross-dressing in our cases may be best
explained, that the feminine strain, normally found in every
male, exists here in a greatly exaggerated form. Every normal
woman attributes an exaggerated value to clothes and, Narcissus-like,
is more or less enamored with the female body.<a id="FNanchor_BH_60" href="#Footnote_BH_60" class="fnanchor">BH</a> The same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span><br /><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
exaggerated value to female clothes is attributed by the male
transvestites. The female transvestite, on the other hand, thinks
of clothes more or less as men do. Yet, the male strain in her,
being a morbid phenomenon, dressing is of more importance
to her than it is to the normal man.</p>

<img src="images/i_pg308.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Dr. M. W., dressed in the masculine garb which she usually wears.</div>
</div>

<p>The case of the celebrated Dr. M. W. shows that even the
female transvestite is greatly concerned in the question of dress.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>She is always dressed in the masculine garb. She attributes great
importance to the liberty of dress. She is constantly agitating for this
liberty. In a letter to a male transvestite, written in Chicago, dated
Jan. 12th, 1913, she says: “I have sent the bill to Albany, N. Y., and to
Springfield, Ill., and expect to speak in both places on the right of
clothes.” Then she continues: “The constitution of the U. S. gives
right to life and liberty, and it makes no exception regarding ‘legs’ and ‘sex.’ It guarantees a republican form of government to every State,
and it is not republican when the State puts the people in dress-chains.”</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Zoöerastia.</i>—One of the most peculiar and monstrous anomalies
of the sexual impulse after homosexuality is zoöerastia or
bestiality, where the individual se conjungit cum animalibus.
The anomaly is as old as history. It was known already at
Biblical times. The Mosaic lawgiver punishes the practice with
death.<a id="FNanchor_BI_61" href="#Footnote_BI_61" class="fnanchor">BI</a></p>

<p>As a rule, bestiality is more due to a certain perversity than
to a perversion. The fact that the zoöerasts are usually found
among those who lack the opportunity for normal congressus
(e. g., shepherds, segregated in the mountains for several months
at a time) would tend to show that the practice is more a vice
than a disease. Still a good many cases of bestiality show a
diseased mentality. Even in the case of Gerstlaner (Arch. f.
krim. Anthr. u. Krimin., xxxvi, p. 154), which looks more like a
vice than a disease, the patient does not seem to be mentally
sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A man was loitering about in the park of a certain town, where
a savage big dog was often seen at large. By some means or other he
managed to entice the dog to come near him. Quibusdam contrectationibus
ei contigit ut voluptatem animalis concitaret. Tum nates
nudavit, se flexit super scamnum, et canem adduxit ut coitum per anum
perageret. During the act two policemen appeared on the scene who
had great difficulty separare canem ab homine.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a case would look more like a vice than a disease.
Still a man who can find sexual satisfaction in playing the rôle
of the pathicus in any coitus per anum is sexually abnormal.
The zoöerastic practices in the case of Sury (Archiv f. krim.
Anthrop. u. Kriminalistik, xxxv, p. 314) are also due to a certain
anomaly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A man forty-seven years of age, twelve years married, was from the
first day he married insatiable in his hunger for sexual activity. Præter
maritam suam servis prædii sui concumbebat. Eodem tempore cum
canibus ovibusque conjungebat et cotidie comprimebat porcam.</p></blockquote>

<p>This man was apparently suffering from satyriasis with
inclination to animals. The following two cases which came to
the notice of the author also show at the first glance a certain
anomaly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a certain village, every once and while, dead hens were found.
Nobody could find the cause of this peculiar occurrence. One day, a
man thirty-five years of age, of high social position, was discovered “in
coitione cum gallina.” He always killed the hens in concarnatione. The
contractions of the sphincter ani in the animal’s last throes increased his
libido.</p></blockquote>

<p>The circumstances in this case, where a wealthy man, who
could easily reach the nearby city with all its opportunities for
normal sex activity, still performs such abominable acts, show
distinctly that the man was suffering from an anomaly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The second case is that of a young man, twenty years of age. He
began to feel uncomfortable and restless. Cold perspiration broke out
all over his body. The knees began to tremble, and he felt a terrible
pounding in his head. At the same time he had the imperative impulse
cum anseribus jungendi. He often struggled against the desire but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
always failed. He simply lost his reasoning power, and when he regained
his reason, the act was committed.</p></blockquote>

<p>No question this patient was suffering from a certain kind
of epilepsy where the fits, necessary for the restoration of the
patient’s equilibrium, were substituted by zoöerastic debauches.
The paroxysmal attacks of psychic unrest and of intensity of
feeling for certain experiences were morbid and due to the same
fundamental factors, underlying the syndrom of epilepsy.</p>

<p>In women, zoöerastia, judging from the paucity of the cases
reported, must be a rare anomaly or vice. The rarity of the
occurrence of bestiality in women may be explained by the difficulty
of making the animal take the active part in the performance.
Still the small number of reported cases may also be due
to the difficulty of proving the existence of bestiality in either
sex.</p>

<p>When young girls, says Moll, are fond of taking canes in
cubilia sua et stupre cum eis ludere, it will be very difficult to
convict them of their vices except in surprising them in the
very act, which can but seldom be accomplished.</p>

<p>The practice of bestiality by women is as old as history.
Besides its mention in the Bible, there is the report by Plutarch
that the Egyptian women who were segregated with the sacred
goat Mendes practised sodomy with the animal. Herodotus himself
saw the women submitting themselves openly to the embraces
of the sacred goat.</p>

<p>Karsch relates that in Kamtschatka the women frequently
conjungunt canibus.</p>

<p>Some cynics claim that the old maid’s love for dogs which
appears so charming and touching, has some deeper reason than
mere fondness for animals.</p>

<p>Moll knows of several cases where women keep dogs stupri
causa, training the animals to practise cunnilingus on them. He
cites a case from the annals of the court, where the woman was
accused quod abusa est cane stupri causa movens animal lambere
genitalia sua.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pfaff records a case of a maid-servant on a farm who trained the
watch-dog secum commisceri.</p>

<p>Maschka relates a case of a woman, forty-four years of age, who
confessed in court se conjunxisse cum cane. Quondam die canis
forte saluit inter femora sua et lambit vulvam feminae. Deinde
femina inter nuda femora sua animal sumpsit et permulsit abdomen
animalis, quoad penis erectus esset. Tum ad sellam nisa, canem
ad se pressit et postquam penem inter labia posuit commovit animal
ut motiones faceret, usque dum ejaculatio veniret.</p>

<p>Rosse reports the case of a young white, unmarried woman in
Washington who was surprised in flagrante delicto with a large English
mastiff, who in his efforts se solvere a puella caused an injury of
such a nature that she died from hemorrhage within an hour.</p></blockquote>

<p>All these cases do not reveal any kind of a perversion. The
practices seem to have been due to vice or perversity. The following
case, communicated to the author by Dr. C., of Tequisquipan,
Mexico, who accidentally entered the patient’s hut while
she was kneeling on her bed “in copulatione cum mulo suo,”
shows distinctly its pathological nature:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient, a widow, thirty-six years of age, was married at the
age of sixteen and had her first child a year later. Her husband died
ten years ago. She had one other child five years ago which died in
infancy. She had always been of a passionate nature. Jam undecim
annos nata cum viris se conjunxit. Stuprum manu faciebat on and off
all her life, especially at the time of menstruation, cum viri ea concumbere
nollent. Concarnationes habebat sedecies una nocte, going the
rounds of the different nightshifts at the mills. About three years ago
she had the first time coitum cum animali. Suus canis erat. Inde sæpe
commiscebatur cum canibus. About a year ago, while returning with her
burro from a neighboring town, duos canes in conjugio vidit, quod se
valde concitavit. Cum mane postmeridianum tempus esset virum celeriter
invenire non potuit. Qua re mulum in casam sumpsit et coepit
contrectare fascinum, donec emersit. Deinde in grabatum reptavit,
posuit muli pedes priores in eo, et ipsa cubitis genibusque nixa est. “Tum
femora muli in tergo suo posuit et postquam penem animalis inter labia
inseruit; coitum solitum cum animali habuit, in quo ea ipsa motiones
fecit celeres aut lentas, secundum necessitatem suam.” She now has the
burro trained so that when she lets him enter the hut he commences at
once to unsheath antequam potest posituram capere.</p>

<p>The examination of the patient showed nothing abnormal in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
organs, except an extreme sensitiveness to touch. The mere separation
of the labia induced orgasm. During the examination she had four to
five orgasms.</p></blockquote>

<p>There can be no doubt that this woman was suffering from
nymphomania. Men could not satisfy her increased sexual desire,
so she took refuge to animals.</p>

<small>HYGIENE OF CHILDHOOD</small></h3>


<p>Personal hygiene means a sound body and mind. It means
the preservation of health, which was humanity’s effort since
time immemorial. Personal hygiene is as old as civilization.
The Bible devotes many a chapter to personal hygiene. The
ancient Greeks spent a considerable part of the day in exercise,
games, etc., in the interest of personal hygiene. The celebrated
Roman baths were established in the interest of the hygienic
development of the body. The Roman maxim was, “mens sana
in corpore sano.”</p>

<p>As far as humanity is concerned, the most important part
in the science of sexuality is the hygiene of the vita sexualis.
Preventive medicine will score its greatest successes in the field
of sexual diseases. If the rules of personal hygiene are followed
they may prevent many an anomaly which, when once established,
is seldom amenable to treatment.</p>

<p>Especially does the principle, “prevention is the best cure,”
hold good in the anomalies of anaesthesia. In almost ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred these anomalies are contracted
through the patient’s own recklessness and fault. If the patient
could be guarded against sexual excesses, the main cause of impotence
in all its ramifications would be removed. But the
necessity of avoiding certain things requires a proper insight
into the nature of these things. To be good requires a proper
knowledge of the evil. “We cannot,” says Hain Friswell (Essays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
on English writers), “be good by pretending not to know evil.
When women go mad, the most innocent, the youngest, the most
purely educated often utter the most horrid and obscene language;
a proof that to them evil has been known; how acquired,
how taught, it is vain to ask. What the teacher ought to seek is,
not to blot out and veil iniquity, since that will always be visible,
but to make the heart strong enough to cast out the evil.”</p>

<p>To accomplish this end proper instruction in matters of
sex is a condition sine qua non. The instruction should begin
before the sexual idea has an emotional garb. When the habit
of masturbation has once been contracted, it is very hard to break
it; when promiscuous life has been tasted, all knowledge of its
dangers will seldom protect the individual from continuing such
a life.<a id="FNanchor_BJ_62" href="#Footnote_BJ_62" class="fnanchor">BJ</a></p>

<p>The missionary work must, therefore, begin in the nursery.
The drunkard is not expected to embrace temperance by acquiring
the knowledge of the injurious effects of excesses in alcohol
upon soul and body. His impaired will cannot resist temptation.
He must be taught to be temperate before he becomes a drunkard.
The same is the case with the boy who has once tasted illicit
venery. All the preaching will generally be for naught. Knowledge
at this time comes too late. The young man who has gone
through all the suffering of gonorrhea and syphilis, as soon as he
is cured, and sometimes even before a perfect cure has been
reached, forgets everything, under passion to resistless impulse,
and associates again with meretricious women. His practical
experience, just as the theoretical knowledge of the medical
student, is not powerful enough to keep away a man from illicit
indulgence, once he has made its acquaintance. But if the dangers
are known to the individual before he has tasted from the
forbidden tree of knowledge, he will, in most cases, avoid tasting
the fruit which may contain one of the deadliest poisons.</p>

<p>Hence the lessons in sex-matters must be given quite early.
It is very unfortunate that even the cultured public has not
learned yet that the young child, even the infant, shows some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
sex manifestation. The general public is unwilling to be enlightened
about the genetic functions of the child. There is no
need to go as far as Freud’s school and reduce the most innocent
infantile natural activities to the emotions of sex; still it is agreed
among the keenest observers that, if infants and small children
are not carefully watched and protected against themselves, lewd
servants, and ignorant mothers, autoeroticism may be established
at such an early period that the first lesson in sex instruction
will come too late. For masturbation, once it has become a habit,
will seldom be relinquished until normal sex relations take its
place, instruction or no instruction.<a id="FNanchor_BK_63" href="#Footnote_BK_63" class="fnanchor">BK</a> The child must be brought
up in such a way that it will reach puberty without any kind of
contamination, either by masturbation or by prostitution.</p>

<p>Only upon such pure and chaste children will lectures on
the dangers of sex irregularities have any influence. The reason
why the medical student with all his supposed knowledge of sex
is not different from any other young man, is that he acquired
his knowledge too late to be of any value. If he had begun his
studies on the pathology of syphilis and gonorrhoea and had
known the dangers of the venereal scourge before he ever had a
taste of sex, it is very likely that with the knowledge of the
danger lurking, not only to himself but also to those dearest to
a man’s heart, his future wife and children, he would abstain
from the association with meretricious venery. But when the
medical student began to gain the knowledge of sex,<a id="FNanchor_BL_64" href="#Footnote_BL_64" class="fnanchor">BL</a> it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
too late for him to resist. Like the habitual drunkard, he had
lost the power of resistance.</p>

<p><i>Education of infants.</i>—The teaching of matters sexual must
hence begin very early in life. Cases are known where masturbation
was started before the first year of the child’s life had
passed. The child has the impulse to touch and pull everything
within its reach. Hence the infant will also try to play with
its genitals. A phimosis or an inflammation of the prepuce,
in the boy, and in the girl uncleanliness in the vulva or pin-worms
in the rectum, may cause itching in the genital parts and
induce the child to touching and rubbing these parts. The
manipulations may cause an agreeable tickling sensation and
may awaken a feeling of lust. The feeling operates then in the
memory and excites to a taste of sexual activity before sexual
consciousness has had time to be naturally awakened through
the growth of the sex-centres.</p>

<p>Sometimes servants, either to quiet the child or out of lust
and ignorance, tickle the child’s genital organs or gently slap
the gluteal region and thus awaken a lustful feeling.</p>

<p>The natural curiosity of children often leads them to an
examination and finally to a titillation of their genital organs,
even without the aid of any vicious instruction.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, the duty of parents to prevent their infants
from becoming masturbators. They must see to it that the child
does not manipulate with its genitals. The little hand ought
not to touch any part below the waist-line.</p>

<p>It should be the nursery-rule not to touch the child’s genital
organs and not to handle the buttocks in any unnecessary way.
Children should not be allowed to sleep in the same room with
their nurses or in the same bed with other children. The child
should acquire the habit of sleeping on the side, not on the
back. The bed should be firm, not soft and yielding. The covers
must be light.</p>

<p>The health of the genital organs must be cared for, and in
case of deviation from the normal, medical aid must be summoned.
A long, tight prepuce, eczema of the genitals, accumulations
of filth and sebaceous matter around the glans of the
penis or of the clitoris, retention of urine beyond the proper time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
pin-worms in the rectum, hemorrhoids, fissures of the anus, all
lead to rubbing, pressing and handling of the genitals.</p>

<p>When the children are old enough to understand, they
must be taught never to handle their genitals, the same as they
are warned not to poke the fingers into their noses, ears, or eyes.
The child must be taught to lie straight in bed, with the hands
never under the cover, must be taught to rise, urinate and dress
soon after awakening.</p>

<p>The child must be accustomed to the sight of the nude, in
art and nature. It will thus become immune against prurient
impressions in the presence of the nude later in life.<a id="FNanchor_BM_65" href="#Footnote_BM_65" class="fnanchor">BM</a></p>

<p><i>Children from four to seven years.</i>—At the period of four
to seven years of age, the child’s curiosity about the origin of
man is awakened. When he approaches his parents with the
question, “Whence do babies come from?” he must not be put
off with stork-stories and false ideas, or met with evasive answers.
The mother should explain to the child that the baby
grows from a seed implanted in the mother’s body, just as the
flower grows from a seed sown in the mother Earth.</p>

<p>After the child has been told of his origin he should be
admonished not to talk of these intimate subjects with others.
He should be warned against allowing any one, little friends or
adults, nurse or teacher, to touch or play with any part of his
body. If an attempt be made by any one, no matter who it
is, be it a little friend, brother, sister, etc., to touch his body,
the child must be taught to report the fact immediately to his
parents.</p>

<p><i>Children from seven to ten years.</i>—At the period of seven
to ten years of age, the child ought to receive its first real sex-lesson
by teaching him the anatomy of the sexual organs of
the plant. The child is told about the cell being the basis of
all organic life. The different modes of reproduction is explained
to him. Then we go over to the study of phanerogamous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
plants and show him that the flower, the most beautiful part of
the plant, is nothing else but the genitals of the plant. We then
analyze every part of the flower, the male and the female principles.
In this way the child will become accustomed to hear,
without apprehension or any thought of impropriety, terms like
male and female germ-cells, ovum, ovary, etc., terms which are
now considered to be unspeakable, save behind closed doors and
then only with low breath.</p>

<p><i>Children from ten to thirteen years.</i>—At the next period
from ten to thirteen years of age, we may begin to explain the
sex-phenomena in the animal kingdom. It is best to follow the
pedigree of the living beings from the lowest, the unicellular
animals, to the highest, the mammals. The teacher could even
describe to the children the complicated indirect cell division,
called “Mitosis,” in order to impress upon their minds the great
importance which the creative power of the universe attributes
to the correct halving of the nuclear substance of the cell.</p>

<p>The child should then get better acquainted with the different
modes of reproduction, the binary fission, the budding, the
sporulation, the conjugation and the different kinds of the latter.
The child may now learn to know the difference between the
hermaphroditic animals and sex-animals, between sperm-cells
and egg-cells. It may learn what is meant by metamorphosis,
by external and internal fertilization, by ovulation and impregnation.</p>

<p><i>Period of puberty.</i>—When the child has reached the period
of puberty, it should learn something about the wonderful phenomenon
of menstruation, which by nature is sure to come to
every normal female, so that the young girl should not be surprised
and frightened by its onset and the boy should not make
jokes over it.<a id="FNanchor_BN_66" href="#Footnote_BN_66" class="fnanchor">BN</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<p>The young girl must be told that nature has reserved this
catamenial week for the process of ovulation and for the development
and perfection of the reproductive system. All the pelvic
organs are in a condition of increased nervous irritability and
in a natural healthy state of congestion. The attention of the
girl must be called upon the participation of the breasts in the
genital congestion. They become extended and more sensitive.</p>

<p>With the irritability of the genital nerves the entire nervous
system becomes impressionate. Especially at puberty, when the
first menstruations set in, the nervous susceptibility is increased
to the highest degree. The child enters the period of storm and
stress. During puberty, says Kiernan, there is normally a
struggle between the cerebral and the reproductive systems.
The latter tends to obtrude subconscious states upon consciousness.
Quite a few of the young boys and girls harbor in their
hearts the so-called “Weltschmerz,” which may be defined as the
subconscious conviction of the emptiness and worthlessness of
existence.</p>

<p>Hence the functions of menstruation should be very carefully
and minutely explained to the girl and the responsibility
of the womanly organism impressed upon her mind, as soon as
the mental symptoms herald the approaching change from
child to maidenhood. Indefinable yearnings and moods, wishes
and fears, the emotions of shame and guilt, of faith and hope,
of love and hate, of vanity and repentance, of sensitiveness and
ambition, assume a certain domination over the growing child.
Sweet inexpressible emotions disturb the thoughts and actions
of the awakening consciousness. Mysterious sensations and impulses
fill the heart of the ripening individual. The bodings of
desires and cravings take possession of the individual’s thoughts
and fancy.</p>

<p>Other symptoms which appear at the time of the onset of
the catamenial period are headaches, restlessness, excitability,
irritability of temper and a general hysterical condition. The
girl is carried away more easily than at any other time. She
often cries without any cause. A certain lassitude seizes her.
She has pain and feels heat in the back and breasts, loins and
in the internal organs. The appetite is often diminished and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
capricious, at this period, just as it is not seldom observed at
the beginning of pregnancy. The girl is not seldom attacked
by sickness and giddiness. If she then goes to bed and remains
in a recumbent position, the blood accumulates in the vagina
and coagulates there before it leaves the system. This coagula
frightens the child.</p>

<p>Hence at the approach of menstruation it is the duty of
parents and teachers to assist the girl with their advice. The
regular regimen at the time of menstruation must be, first of all,
more rest and little physical exercise. Standing too much,
dancing, swimming, horseback riding, cycling, out-door games,
must all be forbidden. The girl needs more sleep at that time.
She must avoid excitement. She must guard herself against
the exposure to draughts, chills or to getting wet feet. Cold
baths must be omitted, but she ought to take regularly her warm
baths. Especially should the genital organs be frequently washed
with warm water. Tight clothing is particularly injurious at
that time.</p>

<p><i>Pollutions.</i>—The boy needs a different lesson at this period.
He has to be told that, at the time of maturity, the testicles
begin to produce or secrete spermatozoa which fill the seminal
vesicles about once or twice a month. Here the sperm is, as
a rule, reabsorbed when no external pressure, such as from the
filled bladder or rectum, is exerted upon the vesicles. In the
daytime the bladder and rectum are regularly emptied, and
the pressure from this side is at a minimum.</p>

<p>During the secretion of the spermatozoa the nerve apparatus
of the genital system is charged with vital energy. When the
tension becomes very high, which coincides with the filling of
the vesicles with sperma, the nervous tension and the physical
pressure are both eager to discharge, respectively, to evacuate.
When the bladder and rectum are filled during the night, their
pressure upon the seminal vesicles becomes so great that the
latter evacuate and thus cause an ejaculation and a change both
in blood and nerve-supply. This relief from the physiological
congestion and nervous tension gives a feeling of satisfaction and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
pleasure. The boy is awakened and is conscious of what has
happened.<a id="FNanchor_BO_67" href="#Footnote_BO_67" class="fnanchor">BO</a></p>

<p>Boys, therefore, must be taught that these pollutions, if
they happen only once to three times a month, are entirely
normal and have absolutely no pathological significance whatsoever.
The appearance of nocturnal emissions is merely a proof
that the boy is approaching manhood. Hence there is no
necessity for him to resort to prostitution to get rid of the
nocturnal losses, or the so-called wet dreams, as many a boy
has done, sometimes even upon the advice of his parent or of
some medical authority.</p>

<p><i>Prevention of masturbation.</i>—At this period, the children
of both sexes have to be warned against the habit of masturbation.
There are three periods in the child’s life when the danger
of masturbation is especially imminent. There is, in the first
place, the period of infancy and early age when the child is
usually seduced to masturbation either by vicious servants or
ignorant mothers, uncleanliness or improper diet. At this time
careful watching of servants, cleanliness of the genitals, details
of diet, as light suppers, non-spicy food, non-alcoholic drinks,
the right way of sleeping, as hard mattresses, the proper dressing,
as light trousers, etc., will prevent early self-abuse.</p>

<p>At the second period when the child enters school the danger
of seduction to self-abuse is again very great. Masturbation is
widely spread in schools. No institution is free from it. In
some schools the evil reaches a wide extension. Particularly
dangerous, as hatcheries and divulgers of the evil, are those institutions
in which numerous pupils are present who have passed
the normal age by several years.</p>

<p>At this time any moral indignation or long-winded sermons
or, what is still worse, punishment, will be of no avail and will
have just the opposite effect. Long talks and repeated turnings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
to the same subject will be of great harm and will only call the
child’s attention upon the evil. Here only a deeply implanted
disgust of the child against children with nasty habits will prevent
the child’s seduction by such masturbators. This feeling
can not be implanted in a day. One lesson will not accomplish
anything, if the parents have not interposed a remark at every
opportune moment during all the years between infancy and
school days.</p>

<p>The third period favorable for acquiring the habit of masturbation
is the time of puberty. At this period systematic
action is of great necessity. All causes of the material genital
congestion, as remaining long in a sitting position, sitting with
crossed legs, riding on chairs, the movements of the sewing
machine, climbing with the legs on poles, retention of urine and
stool, erotic literature, obscene pictures and vulgar plays, all of
which often tend to evoke sexual desire or excite the genital
organs, must be removed.</p>

<p><i>Means against the acquired habit.</i>—When we observe a
child becoming listless, absorbed in thoughts, startled when suddenly
addressed, obstinate, peevish, irritable, morose, taciturn,
when we find its emotions becoming slow and heavy, that it seeks
solitude and shuns play, when we see it becoming pale, with
eyes sunken and surrounded by dark rings, when the lips become
faded and the muscles soft and flabby, we are justified in the
diagnosis masturbation. Sometimes the children are masturbating
themselves in the presence of their elders, and the latter
are not able to interpret the suspicious movements. Any kind
of movements, with the boy’s hands in his trousers, or with the
girls legs crossed, are suspicious and must be interrupted. Near
the orgasm such movements change their character and rhythm,
the eyes become sparkling, the face shows an excited lascivious
expression and respiration becomes rapid. Such phenomena
must be recognized, and the child must be interrupted in its
favorite exercise.</p>

<p>The child having already acquired the habit, we will have
to see that no opportunity is left to him to exercise the same.
Masturbation once learned, it is impossible to stop it before adult
life is reached. In the meantime, the child must be kept busy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
and must be taught self-control. The child must never remain
in bed when not asleep, never sleep lying on its back and never
remain too long in the toilet or in the bathroom. Two children
must never sleep in the same bed or enter together the same
toilet. Stimulating foods and drinks, such as pork, gravies,
pastry with lard, salt-meat, mustard, pepper, rich pies, spices,
candies, pickles, tea, coffee, must be eliminated from the masturbating
child’s diet. Exciting entertainments, lewd pictures,
suggestive reading, all of which tend to increase the child’s sexual
passion, must be withheld from such a child. In addition to
these precautions, we will repeatedly warn the child against the
dangers of excesses of masturbation.</p>

<p>The children are now old enough to understand. Although
the harmfulness of masturbation has been greatly exaggerated,
still it is more injurious than the natural act. Among other injurious
effects, the masturbator uses strong psychical and physical
stimulants, and the harm to health is in proportion to the height
of excitement. Especially injurious to the brain is mental
masturbation. The voluptuous day-dreamers are often unable
to free their thoughts from fancies and pictures of lustful circumstances
when they are alone.</p>

<p>Teachers especially should be alive to the excessive danger
of the so-called platonic attachments among their pupils. The
sentimental fancy taken by an older boy to a younger boy in
boys’ schools, or by an older girl to a younger girl, in girls'
schools, between whom, in the regular course in the school, there
ought to be very little natural companionship, is always suspicious.
The teacher or guardian must know that such attachments,
which appear so touching and romantic, have a most
dangerous resemblance to abnormal passion.</p>

<p>The sequelae of immoderate masturbation are often quite
disastrous. There is, in the first place, general neurasthenia,
with all its accompanying symptoms, as photopsias, glistening
and dazzling before the eyes, photophobias, dry conjunctivitis
(particularly found among masturbating young girls and old
maids), and functional sexual disturbances, as diurnal pollutions
and spermatorrhoea. Other symptoms are indolence, lack of
energy, shyness in demeanor, want of self-reliance, disinclina<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>tion
to study, incapacity for serious work, shortness of memory,
absent-mindedness, unsteadiness of character, hypochondria and
melancholia.</p>

<p>The children become peevish and irritable, they are reserved
in conversation, apathetic in manner, hesitating in actions,
slovenly in dress, and contradictory. Cerebral anemia is of
common occurrence among those addicted to excesses in masturbation.
Hence vertigo is a common symptom and fainting
spells occur often. (Girls especially are liable to be affected by
syncope.) Perspiration breaks forth on the slightest exertion,
and the slightest exercise occasions much shortness of breath.
Neuralgia of the testicles, ovaries and the bladder is also frequently
caused by excess. The neuralgia of the neck of the
bladder is particularly distressing. The patient is frequently
seized with a desire to pass water, and the evacuation of the
bladder is attended with pain. The frequent calls to urinate
occur oftener during the day than during the night. Particular
danger of long-continued masturbation lies in the development
of impotency in men and frigidity in women.</p>

<p>Besides the nervous phenomena, there are often found real
anatomical alterations. As the habit is more frequently indulged
in, the prolonged congestion produces a catarrhal process in the
urethra, prostatic gland, seminal vesicles and varicocele<a id="FNanchor_BP_68" href="#Footnote_BP_68" class="fnanchor">BP</a> in the
male; and in the female, catarrh of the ovaries, tubes, uterus
and especially of the endometrium. These conditions give rise
to uncomfortable and distressing sensations which demand relief
and are gotten rid of only by a continuation of the habit. Thus
a vicious circle is continually at work. The results are stricture
of the urethra, spermatorrhoea, disturbances of the intestinal
tract, as dyspepsia, flatulence and constipation, and palpitation
of the heart.</p>

<p>The congested genital glands, furthermore, excrete and
secrete excessively. In this way the elements of the internal
secretion are either in a state of atrophy or otherwise disturbed.
The organism is thus deprived of these important elements and
suffers accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>

<p><i>Period between sixteen and eighteen years.</i>—When the boy
or girl, at the age of sixteen to eighteen, are about to leave their
families, they will have to be warned against yielding to the
frequent sexual temptations. At this time the boy, and to a
certain extent in our modern industrial world also the girl,
leaves the family to go out into the world to commence the
struggle for existence. There, in the office or in the factory,
the boy and the girl will be surrounded by many temptations.
Innumerable chances will be offered to them to surrender their
chastity. It must, therefore, be impressed upon them how necessary
and important it is for them to be careful and not to allow
the hot temper of youth for the woman, respectively for the man,
to get the better of their prudence.</p>

<p>They have to be warned of the dangers of venereal diseases
and have to be shown the fearful results of promiscuous intercourse.<a id="FNanchor_BQ_69" href="#Footnote_BQ_69" class="fnanchor">BQ</a>
We will speak to them openly about the dangers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
venereal diseases. The diseases of society just as those of the
body, says Stuart Mills, can not be prevented without speaking
openly about them. The social diseases must be spoken in the
open and not with bated breath, and must be spoken to the
woman no less than to the man.</p>

<p>The social diseases have been declared shameful and no one
is allowed to know or to mention them. Many excellent people
look upon venereal diseases as a merited punishment for the sins
of immorality. In the popular conception, venereal diseases are
diseases of debauchery only. There is, on the part of the public,
an indifference, even an active opposition, to sex-enlightenment,
due to the erroneous idea that venereal diseases are the exclusive
appanage of vice. The people are ignorant of the fact that mil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>lions
of guiltless persons contract these diseases through common
utensils and particularly in marriage. These dreadful diseases
embrace among their victims a vast number of virtuous wives
and innocent children. The number of virtuous wives suffering
from venereal diseases is much larger than the entire number of
prostitutes in our country. The wife and unborn child are surely
innocent in every sense of the word. They are incapable of foreseeing
and powerless to prevent the threatening injury.</p>

<p>Syphilis, especially, is not purely a sexual disease. It is
often acquired in the most innocent manner. An almost
inperceptible lesion in the mouth or throat of the syphilitic
exudes a virus which may be conveyed to another person, by a
pen, pencil, drinking-glass, by surgical and dental instruments
and by kissing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some years ago the author treated a pure, innocent, seventeen-year-old
nurse-girl for syphilis of the pharynx who contracted the
disease from the syphilitic infant she was taking care of. Both the
host of the infection and the victim were thus perfectly innocent.</p></blockquote>

<p>Such innocent people surely do not deserve punishment and
ought to be protected. The traditional shameful character with
which the venereal diseases have been invested by popular prejudice
is surely absent in this class of cases. The only practical
protection is the removal of the mist of ignorance.<a id="FNanchor_BR_70" href="#Footnote_BR_70" class="fnanchor">BR</a> Ignorance
of the results of venereal diseases is often ruinous.</p>

<p>Especially is ignorance, prevailing about gonorrhoea, often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
very disastrous. Gonorrhoea is commonly considered a benign
local disease. Young men think it a joke to have gonorrhoeal
infection several times in their lives. They have imbibed false
views in regard to the trivial character of this venereal infection.
They think gonorrhoea is not more serious than a bad cold. The
young man who happens to have escaped gonorrhoeal infection
is the target of his friends’ jests. Yet gonorrhoeal infection may
make a tragedy of marriage by destroying the woman’s conceptional
capacity and rendering her irrevocably sterile, in this
way producing childlessness, and by sending thousands of women
to the operating table to be condemned to the mutilation of their
generative organs to save their lives.</p>

<p>If the proper knowledge of all these dangers would be imparted
to her, it is inconceivable that any woman, with a fair
amount of judgment, would permit the approach of a possibly
tainted man. Every girl, who knew all the dangers of contracting
such a disease, would be more capable of understanding the seriousness
of her taking a false step and would guard herself against
it. If the girl knew of the prevalence of venereal diseases among
men, and her great danger from this source, she would not so
easily debase herself and sully her vestal purity. Only full
knowledge can adequately assist her. Experience has shown again
and again that thousands suffer physical and moral wreckage
by trusting the blind instinct as the sole and sufficient guide for
its regulation. The girl ought to know that the sexual instinct
is imperious in its demands. If she yields to an ardent lover she
runs danger to contract a serious disease.</p>

<p>The ignorance prevailing about the dangers of venereal diseases
is also responsible for the levity with which marriages with
profligates are contracted. By a strange irony of fate, the diseases
of vice, transplanted to the bed of virtue, often become intensified
in virulence. Still with many girls the man who has
most promiscuously and profusely scattered his “wild oats” has
been looked upon as the most favored one among possible husbands.
How there can be anything alluring to marry a man
with a past, when there is the great peril that the young bride
may get up on the morning after the wedding-day an invalid for
life, can only be explained by the lack of knowledge of the gravity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
of venereal diseases. If the mother knew that a man who has
led an unclean life is not a safe husband for her daughter, if she
were aware of the fact that dissipated men do not make desirable
husbands, she would look more for virtue than money in the
future son-in-law. If the girl knew the host of indeterminable
lesions which may follow in the wake of various venereal diseases,
if she knew all the dangers lurking for her and her offspring,
she would never condone moral depravity in her husband and
the father of her children. Her whole nature would revolt
against the wedlock with a man whose body is a sink of corruption.
It will be she who will have to suffer most. It is upon
the woman that the burden of shame and suffering, of disease
and death, is chiefly laid.</p>

<p>The danger of sexual exploitation of young girls by certain
men is much greater, the less the girls are instructed about the
social dangers and the physiological consequences of a chance
acquaintance. The girl ought to be taught that one mistake
blasts a young girl’s life. Let a young woman stray but once
from the path of virtue, or let there be even one breath of suspicion
against her virtue, whether well founded or not, and there
is no forgiveness to her in this world. She has suffered an irretrievable
loss. Her greatest enemy in such a case is woman herself.
Society admits the acknowledged libertine to its most exclusive
circles, but forever ostracises the woman whose one false
step has been found out. The man may emerge from the mire
of dissipation without a spot or blemish upon his character, for
the woman, there is no return. Shame and degradation follow
her even to the grave.</p>

<p>If the girl further knew the physiological consequences of
her transgression, if she knew that she may become gravid, and
thus publish to the world her folly, such cases as are often seen
in maternity hospitals of girls between the ages of twelve to
fifteen years being already pregnant, without knowing the sex
relation, would never be met with.<a id="FNanchor_BS_71" href="#Footnote_BS_71" class="fnanchor">BS</a> Many of these girls have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
no adequate idea of the result of congressus, because no one
has told them.</p>

<p>The prophylactic value of education, which has been applied
to the prevention of almost all communicable diseases, would
surely also be seen in this dreadful disease, this cancer of the
body politic, meretricious venery, this plague of prostitution
which poisons the very sources of the family and of the state.
But for the prevailing ignorance of the girls, regarding the
dangers and pitfalls that beset their lives’ pathway, one million
girls would not have been led into a life of shame in this country.<a id="FNanchor_BT_72" href="#Footnote_BT_72" class="fnanchor">BT</a>
These unfortunate girls do not all come from the slums of
the great cities, as the economic determinists would like to make
us believe, but many come from refined country homes.<a id="FNanchor_BU_73" href="#Footnote_BU_73" class="fnanchor">BU</a> Most
of these devotees of meretricious venery have become so through
the fundamental vice of laziness and defective mentality. It is
sentimentality pure and simple always to speak of betrayed innocence
or dire poverty.<a id="FNanchor_BV_74" href="#Footnote_BV_74" class="fnanchor">BV</a> A vicious disposition, love of pleasure,
and the gratification of the erotic desires,<a id="FNanchor_BW_75" href="#Footnote_BW_75" class="fnanchor">BW</a> are, as a rule,
responsible for the majority of girls embracing the profession of
prostitution. But the most serious among the factors which
work together to bring many a girl to ruin, is ignorance and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
lack of proper instruction. If the girl knew that the career of
the venal woman lasts scarcely five to ten years,<a id="FNanchor_BX_76" href="#Footnote_BX_76" class="fnanchor">BX</a> and that it is a
large sewer, a garbage dump and a crematory, she would surely
not be so easily led to embrace this vile profession. If the girl
knew these facts, it is inconceivable that even the mentally defective
girl would prefer this short life of silks and satins and
then annihilation to a respectable life, even of poverty.</p>

<p>The girl, therefore, must be warned against the allurements
of meretricious venery. She must be told that the average duration
of the career of the venal woman is very short, and that
embracing this profession is almost tantamount to committing
suicide. Before the girl has made the fatal step, she has to be
shown the great slavery and misery prostitution brings upon those
who embrace it as a profession, and that the career of the prostitute
lasts no longer than five to ten years in the average. Then
come ruin and the morgue.</p>

<p>But the young girls are started in life entirely ignorant of
all the dangers about them, and the result is the vast army of unfortunates.
In this way venereal diseases persist, sexual crimes
abound, degeneracy remains and countless victims, year after
year, pay the penalty of ignorance.</p>

<p>The best prophylaxis of impurity is the avoidance of intoxicating
beverages, chance acquaintances, vanity and pleasure-seeking.
The girl’s attention has to be called to the danger
lying in the habit of drinking intoxicating liquors. A girl has
only to taste a drop of liquor in a strange man’s company, and
her chastity is in the greatest danger to desert her for good. It
will not take very long before this girl will indulge in the excessive
use of alcohol, which dulls the moral sense of men and
women.<a id="FNanchor_BY_77" href="#Footnote_BY_77" class="fnanchor">BY</a></p>

<p>The girl has further to beware of the danger of chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
acquaintances. Young men of such acquaintances, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, will do all in their power to induce a girl
to drink intoxicating liquors, and, when she has become excited
by the unaccustomed beverage, they will ruin her chastity.</p>

<p>The girl must particularly be warned of the great danger
lying in vanity of personal appearance. Many a girl has sold
her virtue for fine clothes and outside finery, many a girl has
sold her health, morality and even her soul for a few showy
bawbles.</p>

<p>Last but not least, there is danger in pleasure-seeking and
in an absorbing love of gaiety.<a id="FNanchor_BZ_78" href="#Footnote_BZ_78" class="fnanchor">BZ</a> The seducer, says Block
(Zeitschr. f. Bekämpf. d. Geschtskr., Vol. X, p. 75), is really not
the particular man but the big city. The luxurious hotels, restaurants,
music-halls, theatres, etc., and the elegant clothes of
the rich allure the poor shop-girls, milliners, dressmakers and
servant girls to the career of the mistress in such big numbers
that a pure girl over twenty-five years of age is rarely found in
this class in the big cities in Europe.</p>

<p>Alcohol, vanity and pleasure-seeking thus lead to the evil
of impurity and to a life of ruin, desolation, sickness and degradation.
A girl must, therefore, be made acquainted with all these
pitfalls, in the outside world, before she leaves her mother’s protecting
presence. She has to learn above all the high and holy
function of her genital apparatus and of the sickness, shame and
sorrow which are sure to follow any profanation of these functions.
The subject of venereal prophylaxis has been altogether
too largely taboo among us, hence the venereal diseases continue
to rot the core of society, leaving blindness, deformity, invalidism
and death in their train disseminate.</p>

<p>Even the girl who is sent to college has to know all the
dangers and pitfalls in the outside world. In addition she has
to be warned against the sex-overvaluation by the unhealthy sensualists
of indulgence, found in the modern literature of the so-called
feminists. All those novels, that are written by the
modern woman, says Howard, show an itching of the sexual
centre. The passion is there, but perverted, unsatisfied, mas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>turbatic.
They wish to make man the weak slave of his or her
erotic excitement. They call it in German “Sich ausleben,” “to
live out your life.”</p>

<p>The girl who has chosen an intellectual pursuit has to be
taught before leaving home that the real ethics is the defense of
all external sex-values. Man is more than a mere sex-being.
The spiritual kind of virginity consists in the sensual affairs not
being dominating, exacting or filling the inner life. The Jewish
philosopher, Philo of Alexandria in Egypt, says: “The virgin,
by her company with man, becomes a woman, by the soul’s association
with God, the woman becomes again a virgin.” Such are
the lessons the young girl should take along, when she leaves
home, so that she may be protected against the doctrines of sensual
hyperaestheticism of the modern writers.</p>

<p>The necessity of self-control and chastity must be impressed
upon the mind not only of the young woman but also of the young
man. There is not the slightest support in physiology for the
double standard of morality of the two sexes. Either men and
women should be allowed to lead a promiscuous sex-life,<a id="FNanchor_CA_79" href="#Footnote_CA_79" class="fnanchor">CA</a> or what
is by custom forbidden to the woman should not be allowed to
the man either.</p>

<p>But such lessons will have very little effect upon boys who
have passed childhood and puberty before they have had the opportunity
of receiving proper sex-instruction. Such boys need altogether
another kind of instruction, namely, lessons in personal
prophylaxis. The objection that to teach personal prophylaxis
against venereal infection would remove the most effective obstacle
to sexual indulgence, i. e., the fear of infection, simply
shows the ignorance of the elementary force which indulgence in
venery, once tasted, drives the boy into the arms of prostitution,
fear or no fear.<a id="FNanchor_CB_80" href="#Footnote_CB_80" class="fnanchor">CB</a> The young man himself, once defloured of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
his virginity, is of no concern any longer. All the lessons in
personal prophylaxis will not have the least influence upon his
conduct in life one way or another. But personal prophylaxis
may save his wife and children from a life of invalidism and
even death.</p>

<p>The same procedure will be necessary in dealing with the
young man who is a congenital weakling and has to associate with
meretricibus. He should at least take care not to contract
any venereal disease, which may wreck the lives of his future
wife and children. He should immediately after coition, first
wash with a cotton-sponge the penis—head, shank and under-frenum—with
a solution of sublimate 1:5000; secondly pass
water and make a urethral injection with a solution of 2% protargol,
and thirdly rub a 50% calomel ointment well into the
fore-skin, head and shank of the penis, particularly about the
frenum.<a id="FNanchor_CC_81" href="#Footnote_CC_81" class="fnanchor">CC</a></p>

<p>The best prophylaxis against masturbation, and in a certain
degree also against inchastity, is the coëducation of the sexes.
The familiar intercourse of boys and girls in the kindly presence
of their teachers prevents and appeases the morbid craving of the
sex-appetite, provided the pupils have not been morally tainted
before they entered the coëducational school.</p>

<p>But the comingling of the sexes must not degenerate in
tactile eroticism, as may be observed, on any summer night, in
city parks, on excursion boats, or on hotel verandas at most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
our summer resorts. Of all the five senses, touch is the strongest
sense, it is a sense-world in itself. Touch is the only sense that
has an organ which can be doubled upon itself. The eye cannot
see itself, the ear cannot hear itself, the tongue cannot taste
itself, nor the nose smell itself. But the hand can pass over the
body surface and both feel and be felt. It can perform the feat
of being at the same time both subject and object.</p>

<p>For this reason the sense of touch is especially adapted to be
at the service of the sex-sense. The sense of sex seems to have
made the sense of touch a part of its being. The sense of touch
forms one of the component impulses of the sex-instinct, namely,
the impulse of contrectation. Hence dalliance and caresses form
a substantial part of the sex-act and are unhygienic, if not soon
followed by ejaculation and orgasm. When the act has once
begun, and the often observed caresses do represent the beginning,
it is unhygienic and very harmful not to terminate the
same. The often repeated interruption will lead to all kinds of
sexual neuroses, particularly to psychic and more often to atonic
impotence in men and frigidity in women.</p>

<small>RULES OF EUGENICS</small></h3>


<p>The best prophylaxis against inchastity and its sequels, the
contraction of venereal diseases, is the extirpation of prostitution.
If the supply of the means of inchastity could be cut off, there
would be no demand.<a id="FNanchor_CD_82" href="#Footnote_CD_82" class="fnanchor">CD</a> A considerable part of meretricious
venery could be eliminated by lifting the mist of ignorance.<a id="FNanchor_CE_83" href="#Footnote_CE_83" class="fnanchor">CE</a>
Armed with the proper knowledge a certain percentage of the
girls who are now swelling the ranks of prostitution would surely
shun this profession. But there will still remain the greater part
of venal women, who, according to the best authorities, belong to
the high-grade imbeciles and hence cannot be reached by instruction.<a id="FNanchor_CF_84" href="#Footnote_CF_84" class="fnanchor">CF</a>
This class of women who form the main part of
prostitution will have to be eliminated by following strictly the
rules of Eugenics. Only in this, though tedious but sure, way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
could defective mentality be exterminated, and prostitution thus
banished from our planet within a few generations.<a id="FNanchor_CG_85" href="#Footnote_CG_85" class="fnanchor">CG</a></p>

<p>The aim of eugenics is the production of a better humanity,
especially by the elimination of bodily and mentally feeble stocks.
With the discovery of the Mendelian law, eugenics was placed
upon a scientific basis. The world knew by experience that desirable
as well as undesirable traits are transmitted by heredity,
but it thought that heredity could be controlled by environment.
It believed in economic determinism. Mendel’s law revealed the
inexorableness of the law of heredity.</p>

<p>The science of eugenics teaches that nature is stronger than
nurture. The characters of any living being are determined by
two factors, heredity and environment, or nature and nurture,
but inheritance is more vital than environment. Heredity and
education supply a potential figure, both multiplied give something,
if one is nothing the result is nothing. But heredity is
the weightier factor.<a id="FNanchor_CH_86" href="#Footnote_CH_86" class="fnanchor">CH</a> When nature and nurture compete for
supremacy on equal terms, says Galton, the former proves the
stronger. Neither is self-sufficient; the highest natural endowments
may be starved by defective nurture, while no carefulness
of nurture can overcome the evil tendencies of an intrinsically
bad physique, weak brain or brutal disposition.</p>

<p>No degenerate or feeble stock can ever be converted into a
healthy and sound stock by environment, such as sanitary surroundings,
good laws, education, wealth, etc., as the radical doctrinaires
would like to make us believe. Such means may render
individual members of the stock passable or even strong members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
of society, but the same process will have to be gone through
again and again with their offspring. Improved conditions of
life mean better health for the existing population, greater educational
facilities mean greater capacity for using existing ability.
But lasting improvement can only be secured by breeding from
good stock. The development of the future generations will be
little influenced by environmental improvements, if the conditions
of the blood have been neglected. Nothing can be brought
out from a child by euthenics which is not within him.</p>

<p>The elimination of the feeble stock, met with not only in the
slums but also in the quarters of wealth, which weighs down the
body politic, can only be effected by the prevention of the propagation
of those afflicted with undesirable characters.</p>

<p>There are three methods to effect the elimination of the
undesirables—segregation, sterilization and castration. In the
early history of the human race artificial devices were unnecessary.
Natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, was the
most potent factor of the elimination of the weak. Later on, in
the periods of the Greek and Roman civilizations, the exposure of
sickly children, famines, epidemics and the lack of hygiene served
as the best means of weeding out the feeble and the weak in
mind and body. But as civilization advances a higher ethical
level is reached. The diseased, the weak and feeble are allowed
to survive. Especially since the appearance of Christianity,
which originated among the poor and lowly, charity to the sick,
poor, weak and afflicted has become to be considered the first
duty of human society. The greatest part of all our charities is
in the service of the defectives and the degenerates. The ever-broadening
sympathy and altruism of civilized humanity makes it
possible for the dependent and delinquent classes to survive. We
make the fostering of the unfit and of the cripple our highest
duty. Especially in modern times, the great strides made in
hygiene and in the other medical sciences operate to prolong the
existence of the unfit till the period of propagation. War on infant
mortality and surgical aid have enabled defectives to become
parents. We are trying to make environment safer for the
feebler in mind and body. Manifold facilities are offered for the
survival of the unfit. A social contra-selection has thus set in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
All our sentimental activities in the interest of charity, praiseworthy
as they are, are in the last analysis anti-social.</p>

<p>Our anti-social perverted sentimentality shows itself particularly
in the stand we are taking towards marriage. Marriage and
racial anti-suicide are preached in and out of season. Almost
anybody, the criminal in the Tombs and the deaf-mute in the
asylum, is considered good enough to marry and to propagate.
The result of this preaching is that the improvident, incontinent,
selfish and foolish follow the advice and marry. The less individualized,
the lower the types, the more nearly animal, the
earlier they marry and the more they are fertile. On the other
hand, the superior men and women either do not marry at all
(e. g., Catholic priests, nuns, teachers, nurses, etc.), or marry
very late and practise the voluntary elimination of the family in
the bargain. For the prevention of conception is an accepted
principle among the better classes of every civilized country.<a id="FNanchor_CI_87" href="#Footnote_CI_87" class="fnanchor">CI</a>
Hence the fall of the birth-rate among the most desirable
classes, such as the professional people, best artisans, skilled
mechanics, etc. This falling birth-rate in itself is not at all a
great calamity to humanity, as some reformers and politicians
try to make us believe. It may be dangerous to a smaller State
when threatened by a more populated one, or to an aristocracy
when threatened to be ousted from its privileged position by the
common people. Otherwise the fall of the birth-rate brings
rather benefit than damage to the family and to society. The
deplorable thing is that only the superior classes practise the
limitation of the family; the inferior classes multiply like rabbits.
In this way society is overburdened with the listless and the in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>capable.
Our reformatories, prisons, asylums and homes for the
defective are overcrowded.</p>

<p>The endeavor of eugenics is to restore the former selection
of the fit in place of the present disastrous selection of the unfit.
This eugenics wishes to be effected not by following the brutal
philosophy of a Nietzsche, or by abolishing all charities, or by
exposing weak children, as practised by the ancient Spartans.
The moral law and human sympathy dictate that the children,
once born, should be preserved by all known means. But in the
interest of the race, such children should be prevented from
being born. This need not be accomplished by abolishing the
absolute freedom of selection of marriage-mates, as advocated
by some pseudo-sociologists in Europe. There is no need for the
overthrowing of all human institutions and for the imitation of
the method of the stud-farm, as advocated by the modern race-culturists.
The freedom to contract even of an unsuitable marriage
is always preferable to the tyranny of the state directing the
personal affairs of its citizens.<a id="FNanchor_CJ_88" href="#Footnote_CJ_88" class="fnanchor">CJ</a> The first essential for human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
development is liberty. Liberty is the atmosphere in which character
is formed. No one has a right to exclude two free-born
individuals from marriage. This right is inalienable. To exclude
such a man and woman from marriage relations would be
assaulting the inalienable rights of man which no legislature or
even constitution may do, except by brutal force.</p>

<p>But man has no right to injure his own children. The
careless or wilful procreation of a vicious progeny is not only a
crime against humanity but a wrong to the children who ought
to have remained unborn. Hence it is the solemn duty of any
couple, if there be a taint in their ancestry, voluntarily to exclude
themselves from parenthood. If their mentality does not
enable them to exercise such control, society has a right, nay the
duty to effect the exclusion in its own interest as well as in the
interest of the offspring, who would become a burden to themselves.</p>

<p>This exclusion cannot be realized by laws against marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
of individuals, physically or morally inferior. Such laws are
entirely futile in relation to propagation. Only hypocrites or
perfect fools do not see it. The sex-urge plays a particular rôle
in degenerates. They suffer from a diseased exaggeration of the
sex impulse. No laws, except it be segregation, can prevent the
seduction of the feeble-minded woman or the rape by the criminal
man, and a new generation of deteriorants would arise, marriage
or no marriage. The baneful sentimentality or sordid economy
which allows moral weaklings to roam at large on parole or
suspended sentence can only lead to the breeding of mental and
moral cripples. If the number of the undesirable and unfit
should be decreased, not the marriage but the breeding of the
defectives should be prevented.</p>

<p>Among the means of prevention of propagation, the segregation
of the defectives in different homes (such as asylums for
epileptics, for feeble-minded or for deaf-mutes) would be the
most humane method, but also the most unsafe (temporary
escape is never impossible), and the most burdensome for society.
To segregate people who are still able to support themselves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
deprive society of their earning capacity represents a great economic
loss to the body politic.</p>

<p>The other quite humane method of prevention of propagation
is simple sterilization. The slight operation of vasectomy,
respectively salpingectomy, does not give the least inconvenience
nor does it alter in the least the mental or bodily character of
the operated individual. This small operation has no more effect
upon the person, in regard to his potency, than an obliteration
of the vas deferens in the male or of the Fallopian tube
in the female; and these obliterations cause so little inconvenience
that they remain, as a rule, unknown to the man or
woman. They are only accidentally discovered when the patients
apply for the treatment of their sterility.</p>

<p>Hence all intelligent people who have some hereditary taint
should be taught to renounce propagation by this method. Those
with a neuropathic diathesis or with an alcoholic diathesis, or
who show an inability to learn in school, or those in whose
families are found cases of dementia praecox, maniac-depressive
insanity, or those suffering from incurable inheritable diseases,
such as tuberculosis, cancer, syphilis, hemophilia, color blindness,
albinism, in short of such diseases that do not impair their judgment,
ought to preclude themselves from parenthood by voluntarily
submitting to this mild operation before marriage.</p>

<p>Those, whose judgment is materially impaired to realize the
seriousness of their propagation, such as the incurable insane,
inherent epileptics, the born deaf-mutes, the idiots, imbeciles, and
feeble-minded, should forcibly undergo this operation. Even the
dull and idle should be deprived of the chance of propagating
their kind by means of sterilization. These incompetents and
degenerates furnish the material from which the ranks of the
habitual criminals and prostitutes are recruited. Since we have
learned that the great horde of defectives is due to unfit matings
and that indolent strains arise by the mating of indolent persons,
society has a right and even a duty to weed out these delinquent,
defective and dependent classes by the prevention of the procreation
of the various defective offspring.</p>

<p>The third method of preventing propagation is castration.
Sterilization does not deprive the individual of his desire for con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>gressus
nor of the ability to perform the same, nor of the faculty
of experiencing libido. Hence the murderous and erotically degenerated
criminal classes will remain a menace to society until
they are deprived not only of the potency of procreation but also
of the potency concarnationis and of experiencing libido. The
method of castration, therefore, should be reserved as a penalty
for the outspoken habitual brutal criminal, the rapist, the confirmed
inebriate, the incorrigible burglar or gunman, the gibbering
idiot, or imbecile cretin with the inherited tendency to crime,
and the unstable erotopath. The offspring of this class are predestined
to be degenerates, and one of the two operations is imperatively
indicated. It is preferable that the testicles or ovaries
should perish in such individuals than that their morbidity should
be propagated. In the interest of the patients themselves the
more radical operation is to be recommended. Spayed
animals are always easier controlled. Just as gelding of the
bull and stallion changes the vigorous, powerful, spirited
animals into the comparatively quiet, docile ox and horse, so may
the unsexing or castration of the unfit have a beneficial quieting
effect upon the ferocious, currish, stupid human semi-animal.<a id="FNanchor_CK_89" href="#Footnote_CK_89" class="fnanchor">CK</a></p>

<p>The defectives, when at large, will always find mating facilities
even with the healthy, and thereby drag fresh blood into the
vortex of disease. The progeny of defective parentage are always
defective. Two imbecile parents will never produce a perfectly
normal child. A superior mated with an inferior may sometimes
reproduce the normal, but, as a rule, the progeny of this crossing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
will also be defective. The eradication of every kind of degeneracy
is hence the solemn duty of society to relieve the burden
of the community, and by the reduction of the lower types in each
successive generation, degeneracy could be weeded out of human
society.</p>

<p>The other method of the realization of a superior humanity
is the positive breeding of superior offspring. But this method
of the stock-farm is so antagonistic to our conception of personal
liberty that any liberty-loving nation will prefer panmixia or
blood-chaos, with the freedom to choose their mates by means of
love or even infatuation, to the patriarchic slavery of being mated
like race-horses.<a id="FNanchor_CL_90" href="#Footnote_CL_90" class="fnanchor">CL</a></p>

<p>There is no need for a revolutionary change of the marriage
relations as proposed by the different brands of race-culture. The
ultimate apotheosis of the world will never be reached by the
superman on the terms of Nietzsche. The novel and revolutionary
doctrine as to choice of parents has sprung in essentially unbalanced
minds. If only those undesirables who become a public
charge, either in prisons or in asylums—and sooner or later they
all land there—are one way or another prevented from the propagation
of their kind, the anti-selection, now at work, would cease.
The degeneration of the human race could be stopped, even under
the present conditions of human cultivation.</p>

<small>SEX-HYGIENE FOR ADULTS</small></h3>


<p><i>Engagement.</i>—The boy and girl who, by the proper and
circumspect management of home and school, have succeeded to
remain pure and chaste until their marriageable age need certain
lessons in sexual hygiene to secure the desired happiness in their
future married life.</p>

<p>In the first place they ought to know that true marriage
must be founded upon true love, not upon sensuality. Marriage
founded upon blind passion, aroused by external qualities, is not
capable of enhancing the spiritual and corporal resources of man
and will never bring true happiness of any considerable duration.
Real happiness does not lie in the realization of the desires. Only
true love, not sensuality, can give life or enrich the life of the
married couple.</p>

<p>The essential for a happy union is that the contracting
parties should be more or less each other’s equal. The “law of
parity” is especially true in marriage. Like selects like. The
young people should be of the same social position and, if possible,
of equal education. Love is the union of sentiment, and
lasting happiness in marriage is only possible where there is perfect
understanding between husband and wife.</p>

<p>The young people should further be in full sympathy with
each other’s views of life. The reason why so many marriages
of to-day prove failures is that this rule is disregarded. Modern
men are drunk with sensual pleasure and lay an exaggerated emphasis
on physical qualities. They do not look for responsiveness
and sympathy in their future partners but for vulgar eroticism.
Animal sensuality in all its organic spontaneity control
their choosing of a wife. Hence she is often taken from such
walks of life where pleasure is the chief aim of existence. No
wonder that such actually bought happiness soon languishes, and
the man finds that the woman he has chosen as his life-partner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
has nothing in common with him except the mania for pleasure.
The craze for luxuries of home and dress and the extravagance
of the entire mode of living has taken such a hold upon modern
women that most of them sell themselves into matrimony to the
first man whom they consider able to provide them with luxuries,
without regard to the manly qualities such as courage, intelligence,
education, culture, generosity and chivalry, qualities which
in former times made men attractive to women.</p>

<p>The parties contracting marriage should be of suitable age.
A difference in age from seven to fifteen years will bring the
happiest results. In our climate a woman’s sexual life ceases
about the age of forty-five, and man’s about sixty. Hence there
is a difference of about fifteen years in favor of the man.<a id="FNanchor_CM_91" href="#Footnote_CM_91" class="fnanchor">CM</a> In
our climate the best age for women to become wives and mothers
is from twenty-four to twenty-eight years.<a id="FNanchor_CN_92" href="#Footnote_CN_92" class="fnanchor">CN</a> If the man is then
about ten years older, the couple is physically well mated.</p>

<p>The time between engagement and marriage should be
neither too short nor too long. A period not shorter than three
months and no longer than a year should elapse between the
engagement and the marriage. It is an absurdity to expect real
love from a young man and a young woman, who have seen each
other only a few times, because of the legality of the act. Especially
does it require a certain length of time and considerable
skill and delicacy to overcome the tendency of shyness, which is a
part of a woman’s nature, and of prudishness, which is instilled
in the girl from the very moment she is capable of thinking.
This questionable virtue is taught at home and at school, and becomes
a part of her very being. It follows her as she grows up,
clings to her, influences her and molds her. Hence, if the husband
does not wish to begin married life with rape, he will have
to associate with her long enough, till she becomes aware that the
wife has no need of maidenly coyness and may indulge in the
luxury of bestowing gallant attention without appearing indeli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>cate
and bold. The girl also needs enough time to study the man,
his mode of life, his habits, his degree of honesty and purity, and
what is the principal thing, his health. Love will surely desert
the home where the young bride has left her bridal chamber
afflicted with gonorrhoea or syphilis, and happiness will scarcely
attend the wife and the husband who has spent the strength of
his youth on venal creatures and now looks for a cure and for
restoration by the impotent soiling of a chaste virgin.</p>

<p>Enough time, therefore, should be given both parties for
mutual study. On the other hand, too lengthy engagements keep
the affections and the passions in an excited and unnatural condition,
which after a time tends to weaken the nervous system
and thus undermines health.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The following case is very instructive. Mr. L., twenty-seven years
of age, an assistant professor in a well-known college, and his bride, a
teacher, thought that their economic conditions did not allow them the
luxury of an increase in the family. So they agreed to a total abstinence
of marital relations in the first year of their married life, but
fully indulged in frustrate erotism, such as caressing, etc. The result
is that L. has now to be treated for atonic impotence, manifested by
premature ejaculation.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Wedding.</i>—The wedding-day should be selected to take place
about ten to fifteen days after the end of the menstruation. It is
most desirable that the first sexual relations should be fruitless.
Hence the wedding should be selected during the period when
conception is least likely to occur. The time immediately before
the period, and still more, immediately after following it is the
most favorable to conception. In the first place, ovulation and
menstruation are generally synchronous. Then during the intermenstrual
period the plug of the clear viscid mucus which is secreted
by the cervical glands blocks up the passage and interferes
with the entrance of the spermatozoa into the uterine cavity,
unless removed by female ejaculation which does not always occur
at the right moment. This obstruction is washed away each
month by the menstrual discharge. Impregnation is, therefore,
most likely just after the menstrual epoch, while the middle of
the intermenstrual period is the time of comparative sterility.</p>

<p>The next important question is the selection of the room and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
bed for the married couple. In the aristocratic European families
husband and wife occupy different bed-rooms. Throughout Germany,
even among the poorer classes, husband and wife, although
occupying the same room, have at least different beds. Here in
our country it is the custom, even among the well-to-do, to sleep
in one bed. This unhappy custom, apart from its unaesthetic
aspect at the time of menstruation, leads easily to excesses, and
many a young couple has ruined its life by excessive sexual indulgence.
There should be chastity even in the marriage relations.
It is hence to the best interest of husband and wife that
they should at least occupy separate beds, if the circumstances do
not allow the luxury of separate bed-rooms. The most refreshing
sleep can only be attained by occupying the bed alone.</p>

<p><i>Concarnationis posituræ.</i>—Complexus venerei positurae
numero sex sunt aliis temporibus apud alias gentes usitatæ.
Vir supra, vir infra, stando, sedendo, a latere and praepostero
(more bestiarum).</p>

<p>Normalis atque naturalis mulieri positura est resupina, viro
inter femora mulieris extensa et abducta jacente.</p>

<p>“Qua facie praesignis erit resupino jaceto,” sings Ovid in his
Ars Amandi. In this position the vagina et virile mentulatum
easdem directiones habent, et frictiones inter glandes clitoridis
penisque, which are the most sensitive organs for inducing
libido, are facilitated. The supine position is hence mechanically
the most favorable for the frictions of the most sensitive parts.</p>

<p>The position a posteriori (more pecudum) is not so favorable
for the frictions of the clitoris. The female orgasm will
hence, at best, be retarded. The prone position is, therefore, not
the hygienic ideal, at least so far as the female is concerned. The
popular belief that this position is more exciting for male and
female is based upon the assumption that the intensity of the
libido is proportional to the depth insertionis in vaginam fascini.
This belief is erroneous. The radix of the penis, as well
as the fornices of the vagina, are, as a rule, the points of the
least value for inducing orgasm, and these are the very points
most affected by the frictions in the prone position. The portio
vaginalis and the os externum which are sexually very excitable
are, in the prone position, not easier reached by a normal fas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>cinum
than in the supine position. In normal cases,<a id="FNanchor_CO_93" href="#Footnote_CO_93" class="fnanchor">CO</a> therefore,
the prone position of the female is anti-hygienic.</p>

<p>In women with orgasmus retardus of moderate degree, positura
viri infra may be of some benefit. This position damps
somewhat the male ardor, et impeditæ sunt motiones, dum
mulier moveat cito aut lente so as to produce the best effects
upon her own orgasm.<a id="FNanchor_CP_94" href="#Footnote_CP_94" class="fnanchor">CP</a></p>

<p><i>Frequentatio concubitus.</i>—Congressus frequentatio varies
with different individuals, but with the majority, under
thirty years of age, three times a week should be considered sufficiently
frequent, between thirty and forty twice a week, and
less frequently as age advances.<a id="FNanchor_CQ_95" href="#Footnote_CQ_95" class="fnanchor">CQ</a> When concarnatio is followed
by a sense of relief and comfort it is beneficial, and to be thus
guided is the most rational practice. The criterion of marital
hygiene, as far as frequency is concerned, is hence the state of
the feelings of the couple. The day post initum both mates
must feel refreshed in body and spirit, otherwise the act was
unhygienic.</p>

<p>If one of the mates has greater sexual desires than the other
is able<a id="FNanchor_CR_96" href="#Footnote_CR_96" class="fnanchor">CR</a> or willing to gratify, he or she has to suppress the erotic
excitement by the exertion of will-power or by cold sponging,
cold baths and when necessary even by bromides. For while
chastity does very little harm to the individual, excesses in venere
destroy in time both body and mind.<a id="FNanchor_CS_97" href="#Footnote_CS_97" class="fnanchor">CS</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<p>The frequent exercise actionis conjungendi leads directly
to anaemia, malnutrition, asthenia of the muscles and nerves, and
mental exhaustion. Immoderate persons are pale and have long,
flabby and sometimes tense features. They are melancholic and
not fit for any difficult and continued bodily or mental work.
They possess very little power of resistance. The patients suffer
from aboulia or inability to concentrate their minds upon any
subject. There is a certain dysaesthesia or hyperaesthesia of the
senses, especially against noise and light. Insomnia is very frequently
complained of. Cephalalgia and vertigo is a frequent
occurrence. The patients have a feeling of anxiety in stomach
and in heart-regions. Anorexia, or loss of appetite, is often met
with. Besides, the patient suffers from nervous dyspepsia and
constipation which not seldom alternates with diarrhoea. There
is often found tachycardia and an arythmic or intermittent pulse.
Sometimes asthma and coughing are complained of. The patients
feel fatigued at the least exertion. The most annoying
symptom is pollakiuria and cystic tenesmus. In men pains in
the back are radiating to the legs and to the inguinal and
spermatic-cord regions; in women coccygodynia is often encountered.
These effects frequentis commixtionis are often seen in men and
women after a certain period of married life has elapsed.</p>

<p>Apart from the bad effects upon the general health of the
man and woman, excesses in venere cause various local disturbances.
Too frequent sexual excitement retards the orgasm or
makes it impossible. The detumescence that normally occurs
after ejaculation does not take place. The genital organs remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
thus in a certain state of congestion which causes chronic inflammations,
such as prostatitis, vesiculitis, orchitis or urethritis in
men, and vulvitis, vaginitis, endometritis, metritis, salpingitis,
ovaritis or peri- and parametritis in women. The habitual congestion
of the uterus causes the tissues to become succulent, and
the vessels enlarged. It shows, then, all the symptoms of subinvolution,
such as menorrhagia, exhaustion and sexual apathy.</p>

<p>Sexual excess, as everything else abused, produces satiety and
finally indifference. Emptiness in life is then the individual’s
lot, and it falls into a state of moral apathy which is characterized
by the suspension or complete loss of every sentiment.<a id="FNanchor_CT_98" href="#Footnote_CT_98" class="fnanchor">CT</a></p>

<p>Young and healthy people are able to induce orgasm several
times daily. With them orgasm is possible after many excesses.
But even in youth frequent practice congressus ruins the individual’s
health. The frequent inducement of the orgasm weakens
the nerves of the sexual sphere. At the time of the orgasm peristaltic
movements of the vas deferens in its entire length and of
the ejaculatory ducts in men and of the tubes and uterus in
women take place. If these delicate movements are too frequently
repeated they cause diseases of the genital nervous system.
The frequent irritation of the frictions furthermore causes
a complete transformation of the covering of the glans penis and
of the vulva and of the vaginal mucous membrane. It becomes a
veritable skin, a shriveled parchment, which the sebaceous secretions
no longer soften. This transformation affects profoundly
the genital sensibilities, and if it does not completely destroy the
amatory pleasure it at least weakens it considerably.</p>

<p>The urethra is also affected by excesses in venere. In women
the meatus externus is more or less open. This dilatation may
often be continued the entire length of the urethra and even affect
the sphincter of the bladder. Hence the incontinentia urinae
that is often found in masturbating little girls and in newly-married
young women.</p>

<p>In the beginning of married life the principle commended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
the husband should be that an alarmed and reluctant bride should
be patiently wooed and never ravished.<a id="FNanchor_CU_99" href="#Footnote_CU_99" class="fnanchor">CU</a> The delicacy of caution
and restraint is of great importance, especially at this juncture
which marks the outset of connubial relations. The entire change
of life at this period exerts a strong influence upon the physical
condition of the young bride. She needs time and rest to get
used to the new condition of things and to reconcile it to her
ethical views. If these matters are not respected by the husband,
the death-blow to the young love is already dealt in the
first days of married life.</p>

<p>There is, furthermore, always more or less suffering on the
part of the bride in primo concubitu, partly due to the rupture
of the hymen and partly to the forcible dilatation of the
vagina. These pains are not confined only to the time of the
act, but continue day and night, and represent a really diseased
condition. Hence sufficient time should be allowed after defloration
for nature to repair these injuries. Frequent indulgence
at this period of married life is a prolific source of inflammatory
diseases and occasions ill health.</p>

<p>One period in the woman’s life in which it is extremely
dangerous to practice congressio is the time of menstruation.
Yet immoderate women are prone just at that time delicias
compressionis cupere, because the cycles of sexual excitement
coincide with the menstrual period. The normal and primitive
characteristic of the menstrual state is the more predominant
presence of sexual excitement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the author’s patients, a young woman of twenty-two, mother
of one child, was sexually so excited during menstruation that her
husband asked for a remedy to appease his wife’s excitement quæ menstruata
poscebat concubitus frequentes. Initus during this period had
an unaesthetic effect upon the highly cultured husband.</p></blockquote>

<p>The increase of the sexual impulse usually begins a few
days before menstruation sets in and lasts a few days after its
cessation. Yet, although there is an extreme enhancement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
concupiscence during the catamenial period, the aversion to
initus during this time by men and women is, generally, real.
It is due not to lack of sexual desire, but to inhibitory action of
powerful extraneous causes that are largely psychological in
character. There is the aesthetic repugnance to union, when
such a condition obtains, then there are the inhibitory effects
derived from the educational suggestions, inculcated in females
as well as in males from the time of puberty.<a id="FNanchor_CV_100" href="#Footnote_CV_100" class="fnanchor">CV</a></p>

<p>Common experience has also shown since time immemorial
that concarnatio during this period is fraught with many dangers.
Prominent among them is the possibility of rupturing the impaired
vessels and of causing haematometra. The marital relations
should, therefore, be suspended during the menstrual
period.</p>

<p><i>Pregnancy.</i>—In the higher animals the female does not admit
the male after impregnation has taken place. In man it is
different. The act is here a relation of love, mutually demanded
and enjoyed by both sexes. It serves other purposes besides that
of procreation. Hence initus does take place during pregnancy.
Although the woman’s sexual appetence is somewhat lessened
during that time, yet the libidinous cycles generally continue far
into the later months of pregnancy. In some cases an increased
sexual desire has been observed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the author’s patients, a lady of twenty-two years of age,
was sexually so excited during her first pregnancy that ter quaterque
quot noctibus congressus petebat, and but for the refusal of her husband,
she would have indulged in more frequent gratification.</p>

<p>Another woman was known to the author who became sexually so
excited during her pregnancy that for the gratification of her increased
sexual desires meretricium faciebat for the entire period.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is, therefore, no natural cessation of the sexual desires
even in a woman. Yet at that time, concarnatio should very
rarely be indulged in. If it is practised too frequently it leads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
to considerable disturbances of circulation, and the result may
be a miscarriage. Another danger lurking from initus at the time
of pregnancy, is the infection of the woman. If it is admitted
that the finger of the obstetrician may be the agent of infection,
we can hardly deny that the penis may exert the same influence.
The husband should hence abstain from sexual relations with his
wife during the latter days of gestation.</p>

<p><i>Confinement.</i>—Concarnatio immediately after confinement is
as dangerous as during menstruation. It will be productive of
even greater dangers than in ordinary menstruation.<a id="FNanchor_CW_101" href="#Footnote_CW_101" class="fnanchor">CW</a> It is,
therefore, an old rule that after a confinement a respite of at
least six weeks should be had. In the first weeks after confinement,
concarnatio leads to congestion of the muliebria and hence
to inflammations. The organs must have time to return from
their congested to the normal state. For this involution they
need about two months, and during this time initus should be
avoided.</p>

<p><i>Lactation.</i>—During lactation the woman’s nerves are weaker
than usual, and for that reason, concarnatio should be rarely
indulged in.<a id="FNanchor_CX_102" href="#Footnote_CX_102" class="fnanchor">CX</a> If concarnatio is too often practised during lactation,
menstruation may return too early, prevent the secretion
of the milk, and cause subinvolution of the uterus. Then there
is always the danger of a new pregnancy, which will interfere
with the process of lactation.</p>

<p>In nervous and excitable people very frequent concarnatio
should be avoided at all times. The frequent genital irritation
causes an increase of sexual excitability which is detrimental to
their health. Such people should avoid everything that tends
to increase sexual excitability, as, e. g., the immoderate use of
alcohol and meat, very rich and highly seasoned food and carbonated
waters. The best criterion for them whether they are
indulging too much in sex-activity is their own state of health.
If initus is succeeded by languor, depression or weakness, it has
been indulged in too frequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span></p>

<p><i>Spatium temporis concarnationis.</i>—The normal duration or
length of time necessary to remain in initu before the orgasm is
reached is different in different individuals but is somewhat in
control of the individual. It must not be too rapid nor should
it require too long a time. If both parties tend to come to the
climax at the same time, it is best to follow the rule not to
hinder the natural succession of the act. It is best to go with the
current without trying to resist it. It is not hygienic to prolong
the session beyond measure by artificial delays and by alternative
entering and withdrawing. The subtleties may increase the
libido of both mates at the time being, but they are fraught with
peril.</p>

<p>As a rule the climax does not come at the same time in
both mates. In the woman the orgasm is, generally, induced a
moment later than in the man. The woman, therefore, must
first be prepared initu. Non est marito cœundum priusquam
conjugæ voluptas est illecta et vulva vaginaque humescunt secretionibus
voluptificis. Præparatio partium consistit in osculis,
contrectationibus et permulsionibus. Such dalliance has been
decried by some ascetics as obscene and beneath a man’s dignity.
But nothing is low if born of love. Qua re permulsio muliebrium
a marito, contrectatio mammarum et ludus cum mamillis
voluptificissimum erit et illicient conjugam.<a id="FNanchor_CY_103" href="#Footnote_CY_103" class="fnanchor">CY</a></p>

<p>In partial frigidity, the male must, apart from the preceding
manipulations, have special regard to the expiration of the female
excitation, even after congressus has begun.</p>

<p>Cum muliebria humescent, fascinum inserendum est as
far as possible and the motion following be exceedingly
slight, hardly more than a tremor, while the root of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
mentulæ compressa est contra clitoridem. Deinde actio propria
incipiat. Cum climax propinquet fascinum extrahendum et, si
necessitas, abstergendum est. Tum actio resumenda est. This
procedure may be repeated again and again until the female
approaches her orgasm so closely that she will not permit detractionem
any more. The climax will then be simultaneous in
both mates.</p>

<p>The hygienic rule in regard to duration is hence briefly this:
The man must adjust himself to the condition of the woman, so
that both may reach the culmination at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Offspring.</i>—The hygiene of the vita sexualis in relation to
the offspring is of the greatest personal as well as social importance.
The most favorable time for child-bearing is between
the twenty-fourth and the fortieth year of the woman’s life.
Before and after this time child-bearing is of disadvantage for
the mother as well as for the child.</p>

<p>The interval between two confinements should be no less
than two and a half years. Twelve months for lactation, nine
months for reparation from the nervous strain of lactation, and
nine months for the next pregnancy. The maximum number of
children compatible with health should thus not exceed seven.
The moderate bearing of children, despite its physiological expense,
is conducive to health.</p>

<p>The middle part of the intermenstrual period is, as a rule,
the most sterile. If the couple is anxious to have a child, the best
time for concarnatio is from the third to the eighth day after the
flow has ceased. The time from the fifth to the second day before
menstruation is not so favorable as the days after the period. The
greater part of conception follows concubitus practised in the
eight days following menstruation.<a id="FNanchor_CZ_104" href="#Footnote_CZ_104" class="fnanchor">CZ</a></p>

<p>Hence a couple desiring a child should be advised that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
eight days following menstruation, while not absolutely dependable,
yet present the most favorable time for conception.</p>

<p>The time of the day most favorable for the congressio depends
upon the purpose of the act, whether it is practised for the
sake of procreation or for pleasure only. The horizontal position
post initum favors the retention of the semen within
the vagina, the erect position its expulsion. The motionless reclining
position of the woman after the generative act is, hence,
favorable to conception. The act, therefore, should not be practiced
immediately before arising.<a id="FNanchor_DA_105" href="#Footnote_DA_105" class="fnanchor">DA</a></p>

<p>The season is also claimed to have some influence upon the
offspring.<a id="FNanchor_DB_106" href="#Footnote_DB_106" class="fnanchor">DB</a></p>

<p>Dispareunia of the two mates is often of great importance
for the offspring. Orgasmus retardatus in the male does not cause
dispareunia. In such a case concarnatio may be protracted for
hours without interference by the muliebria. But when the
male tends to reach the orgasm too quickly for his particular
mate and the erection ceases, then the female orgasm does not
take place at all, and we have a case of dispareunia.</p>

<p>Now, at the moment of the female orgasm the uterine suction
takes place, by which sperma is drawn into the uterine cavity.
Hence if the male orgasm occurs too soon and the woman does
not reach this stage at all, female ejaculation and uterine suction
fail to appear. This circumstance may seriously interfere with
the entrance of the spermatozoa into the uterus and thus prevent
conception.<a id="FNanchor_DC_107" href="#Footnote_DC_107" class="fnanchor">DC</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span></p>

<p>The male, therefore, has to be taught to prevent his premature
orgasm by an effort of the will or by so varying the
motions as to delay the climax. He has to retard his orgasm so
that both mates may reach the culmination at the same time.</p>

<p>Sometimes the entrance of the spermatozoa is prevented by
a diseased or narrow cervical canal. In this case the repeated
application of the constant electric current, after Apostoli, with
the kathode in the uterus, will cause a cure of the catarrh and
a more lasting dilation of the cervix than all the instrumental
dilatations and the usual curettages will ever effect.</p>

<p>While in the interest of the offspring the horizontal position
of the woman after initus is most desirable, and concarnatio
should hence take place in the beginning of the night, the rules
are somewhat different, if initus is practised for libido only.</p>

<p>Initus is slow and dangerous immediately after a meal and
during the two and three hours which the first digestion needs, or
after having finished a rapid walk or any other violent exercise.
In the same way, if the mental faculties are excited by some
mental effort, by a theatre party or a dance, rest is necessary, and
it is advisable to defer amatory delights till the next morning.
After the calm and the rest of the night the bodily organism and
the intellectual faculties are in a happy serenity and the sensibility
has the whole virginity of its impressions. On the other
hand, initus ought to be avoided in the morning immediately
before rising. The time for beginning daily occupations is by
no means favorable to the attainment of a happy lassitude. The
most propitious hour for initus is, therefore, during the night
after the first sleep.</p>

<p><i>Impeditio conceptionis.</i>—The most frequent method employed
conceptum impeditare is that of coitus interruptus, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
onanism at the moment when it is felt that ejaculation of the
semen is about to take place. The male orgasm then occurs
outside the vagina, and the female orgasm is, as a rule, not
induced at all. This practice is very injurious to both mates.
Although the male act is allowed to reach its acme, still the
ejaculation occurring outside the natural place, the proper satisfaction
is missing, and there remains a constant hankering after
the repetition concubitus which leads to excesses. Besides, this
constant feeling of dissatisfaction causes in the long run a number
of serious symptoms in both mates.</p>

<p>The weakness of the brain is manifested by phobias and
psychic effects, as ill humor, headaches, vertigo, syncope, insomnia,
spasms of laughter or crying, irritability, fatigue and spinal pains.
The affections of the gastro-intestinal canal are, spasm in swallowing,
nausea, ravenous appetite or loss of appetite and constipation.
The affection of the lungs is shown by nervous asthma.
The heart shows palpitation and tachycardia. The genito-urinary
system shows the following symptoms: impotence, frequent urination,
hyperaesthesia in urethra, pressure in perineum, neuralgia
of the testicles and spermatorrhoea. The muscles and skin
show their affection by a certain tremor, paraesthesia in the legs
and perspiration at the least exertion.</p>

<p>Besides these symptoms, found in men and women alike,
the female shows serious local symptoms. In the woman congressus
interruptus prevents the inducing of the orgasm. In
this way the tumefaction of the female genitals is not removed.
The genital organs become engorged and are not allowed to enjoy
the relaxation, consequent upon the completion congressus. If
these interrupted sexual meetings are often repeated, serious diseases
of uterus and ovaries develop. The uterine walls become
dense and thickened and the menstruation is disturbed. The
woman suffers from pains, tenderness and the sense of bearing
down. In the course of time the absence of the detumescence
causes real chronic disturbances, such as vulvitis, vaginitis, erosions
of the cervix, endometritis, retroposition of uterus, salpingitis,
oöphoritis and even fibroids or cancers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as this practice of coitus interruptus does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
allow the impulse of detumescence to be gratified, after every
preliminary step has been taken to arouse it, the woman often
takes her refuge to stuprum manu. Hence we find after a certain
lapse of time, the clitoris to be considerably enlarged in volume
as well as in length. The prepuce is thickened, the labia minora
are enlarged, wrinkled, contracted and slate-colored. They are
frequently covered with black spots, due to an accentuated pigmentation.
Repeated friction produces coxcomb labia, and thigh
friction, mostly found in young girls, is the cause of one lip being
larger than the other. The urinary and the vaginal orifices are
open, the constrictores vesicae and cunni having lost their
tonicity.</p>

<p>To avoid all these serious consequences in the woman, it has
been suggested fascinum non est extrahendum until the woman’s
impulse of detumescence has been satisfied and the tumefaction
muliebrium removed. Such initus has been claimed to be of the
same value for the woman as the normal. But the greatest drawback
to this mode of concarnatio is that very few men will be able
to perform such a delicate act. It requires a great concentration
of mind to succeed. Besides, it would be an error to consider such
concarnatio normal, even for the woman. For it is not entirely
a matter of indifference to the woman whether the sperma flows
into the vagina or not.<a id="FNanchor_DD_108" href="#Footnote_DD_108" class="fnanchor">DD</a> Initus involves the transmission into the
female organism of certain fluids from the man, which have a
beneficial effect upon the woman. This is often demonstrated by
the helpful effect marriage has upon weak and anaemic girls. A
happy union is the charm wherewith to banish chlorosis and many
other female ailments and irregularities. The influence of the
seminal excitation is quite different from the copulative excitation.
If the latter is induced while the former does not follow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
the practice will cause in the woman debility and sometimes even
nervous prostration.</p>

<p>Any device to prevent the entrance of the sperma into the
vagina or uterus, such as condoms, cervical obturators or sponges,
for the same reason, have an injurious effect upon the woman’s
general health. Besides, all these devices do not prevent at all,
especially the sacrifices at the door of the temple do not always
afford security against an accidental conception. The spermatozoa
with their faculty of motion may penetrate into the female
genital tract without the introduction of the mentula into the
vagina, and no obturator or sponge can close up the os uteri so
tightly that the spermatozoa will not be able to find their way into
the uterine cavity. No condom is strong enough that it will not
occasionally burst, and all the precautions of months are suddenly
set at naught.</p>

<p>The following history shows that the introduction of the
fascinum into the vagina is not an absolute necessity for pregnancy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An uncle brought his niece, eighteen years of age, to the author
with some indefinite intestinal complaints. Several physicians made the
diagnosis pregnancy. But the girl, knowing that she never had any
carnal relations, laughed at their diagnosis. The examination showed
an intact hymen and a vaginal lumen which had never been dilated.
But the combined examination per rectum did reveal a four months'
pregnancy. The girl was told that her virginal state showed that she
really never had any carnal relations, but that dalliance with a lover
during which ejaculation takes place upon the crines volvulæ may
be the cause of pregnancy. This must have happened in her case.
Thereupon the girl broke down and confessed that such dalliance has
been indulged in.</p></blockquote>

<p>Minime perniciosa marito maritæque sunt suppositoria medicata,
pulveres et injectiones acidae statim post initum. But they
are all no more trustworthy in killing the spermatozoa than congressus
interruptus and all the other anti-conceptional devices.
They all fail without exception.<a id="FNanchor_DE_109" href="#Footnote_DE_109" class="fnanchor">DE</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span></p>

<p>The best means conceptionem impedire is total abstinence,
which is perfectly harmless for those who are able to accomplish
it. Chastity does no harm to the soul nor to the body. The belief
that abstinence causes diseases of the genitals or impotency
of any kind is a great error. Love never dies of want, but it often
dies of indulgence. Abstinence has for those who are able to
maintain it no harmful consequences. But it may be said that
sexually normal individuals are generally unequal to the task.
Especially is abstinence almost impossible in married people,
whose nerves are keyed to the highest pitch by the close intimacies
of their lives.</p>

<p><i>Means of sexual excitement.</i>—In our modern way of living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
even moderation in sexual matters seems to be impossible. Not a
few of our young men are satyrs and our young women nymphomaniacs,
who “faute de mieux” seize on stuprum manu. Once
married they know no restraint. They are living in constant
sexual excitement.</p>

<p>There are five special influences that incite to sexual overindulgence.
The abuse of spirituous liquors, which has reached
alarming proportions among modern women, increases their sexual
desires and destroys their natural modesty. Dancing is another
cause of sexual excitement. To-day young girls in their
teens frequent public balls and receptions, dance with male
partners, and mutually excite each other. The modern stage is
another important factor in sexually overstimulating the passions
of many of our young men and women. The modern stage no
longer appeals to the intellect of trained minds that have reached
a certain age. The modern stage is more sensual, it lays the main
stress upon the scenery, which may be enjoyed by young boys and
girls, scarcely passed the period of puberty. The play is, as a
rule, an ordinary, every-day, small suggestive love-affair. (It is
euphemistically called a realistic play.) Nude and vulgar art
and impure literature have another great influence in exciting
sexual desires. The modern novelist finds his greatest delight in
descending to the gutter in search for his heroes, and knows no
higher aim in art than to give a realistic picture of the blandishments
of bad women and of the allurements of degenerated men.</p>

<p>One of the strongest sexual excitements which, directly concern
only men but indirectly leads to mutual erethism, is the
modern woman’s dress. Although from time immemorial woman
always so dressed as to accentuate and bring into prominence
her secondary sexual characteristics, yet the former modesty, the
customs and certain sumptuary laws dictated moderation in this
respect. The modern woman acknowledges no restraint. She
copies slavishly the Parisian fashion, which, as a rule, is a creation
suggested by the demi-mondaine and designed to increase
her trade by exciting the passions of the other sex. The modern
woman, throughout the civilized world, consciously or unconsciously,
imitates her erring Parisian sister. Not only does she
try to bring into bold relief by means of the corset her main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
secondary sexual characteristics, her bosom and her pelvis, but
by means of her hose supporters, her legs and the space between
them are only partly veiled. Thus a really obscene effect is
created which is far more exciting than if she were perfectly
nude. The effect of contrast and expectation renders the partly
veiled nudity more exciting. This is the psychological reason
why man tries to conceal his natural state and covers it by artifice,
while animals try to win their mates by showing and exposing
their sexual qualities.</p>

<p>All these artificial excitements tend to create voluptuousness
and lead to excesses in venere. These excesses have the indispensable
consequence of making a large number of our men and
women highly neurasthenic.<a id="FNanchor_DF_110" href="#Footnote_DF_110" class="fnanchor">DF</a></p>

<small>THE MORAL STANDARD</small></h3>


<p>Moral judgments claim to be subjective and demand assent
from all men. Hence they imply a standard by which the claims
can be tested. What is this standard? In logic there is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
abstract truth which is the standard of thought. In ethics there
must be an ideal good which furnishes the criterion of what
ought to be. What is this ideal supreme good, by which the
ethics of an action can be judged?</p>

<p>Only revealed religion approached the question of morality
in a logical way. It first created as a standard of morality the
will of God, as laid down in the sacred scriptures and traditions
of every creed. If the philosopher, or rather the freethinker, can
not accept the standard of revelation he must find some other
criterion for general morality, or rather he must learn in some
way to read the will of the supreme intelligence. Every advance
in science, the unlocking of every secret in nature, every interpretation
and revelation of her laws that comes to man through
scientific research proves, confirms and stamps, with the seal of
eternal truth, the existence of a supreme intelligence, the Great
First Cause, the Soul and Source of all life, energy, and intelligence.
When the will of the supreme intelligence is found, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
there is also found the standard of morality. A philosopher can
not raise his finger and say this is moral and this immoral.
Such an arbitrary standard must lead to chaos, disorder and
confusion in the realm of morals. The moral sense is the last
to be developed and the first to be confused and disordered.
With the dogmas of revealed religion the old standards of
morality were also swept aside, and the modern moralists have
no foundation to build their moral systems upon, hence their
drifting from one system to another, from economic determinism
to the worship of the superman, to work-worshipping, love-worshipping,
or pleasure-worshipping.</p>

<p>Among all the modern systems of moral conduct, the radicals
who are building theirs upon economics have chosen the
easiest way. They simply borrowed the ideal of revealed religion
and raised it to their moral standard. They preach economic
equality. This represents their religion, their economics, their
morality, their all. Their watchword is, social justice by giv<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>ing
the laborer the full share of his labor. This principle of
social justice has been borrowed from the Judeo-Christian
creed.<a id="FNanchor_DH_112" href="#Footnote_DH_112" class="fnanchor">DH</a></p>

<p>Social justice composes the chief part of the religious tenets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
of the Bible. Even Nietzsche (Jenseits des Guten und Bösen)
considers the Old Testament as essentially the book of Divine
justice. אל רחום וחנון a God of mercy and pity is Jehova—, but
אל רחום וחנון he will by no means clear the guilty. (Exodus
xxxiv, 6-7.) Even the passage in the stern Nahum (I, 2)
אל קנוא ונקם is falsely translated, “a god of revenge.” It really
means “He is a god of retributory justice.” The prophetic teachers,
just as the present-day socialists, never asked for love and
mercy but for right and justice. The portrayal of a pious man
in ancient Israel is given in Job xxix, 12, and xxxi, 13. It is
the man of strict social justice. Philo Judeus (Περὶ Φιλανθρωπίας)
pointed out the greatness of the social law in ancient Judaism.</p>

<p>These Biblical ideas of liberty, equality and brotherly love
have been taken up by the altruistic materialists and raised
to the top of the mountain of life as a beacon for humanity’s
fragile skiff. But the sources whence these ideals originated
are not only entirely ignored but are reviled, defamed
and ridiculed by these radicals. The socialists did not create
the ideals of social justice, as found in their doctrines. They
borrowed them from the Jewish-Christian creed, and as atheists—ninety
per cent. of them profess atheism—they repudiate this
same creed. They borrow the ancient religious ideals of charity
and social justice from Christianity and repudiate Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_DI_113" href="#Footnote_DI_113" class="fnanchor">DI</a>
As altruistic materialists, they are theologically agnostics, but
their impulses are Christian. But by this repudiation of religion
they forfeit the very foothold to stand upon. Religion has
behind its ideal the authority of the divine will. What is behind
the materialistic ideal? What is the goal of materialism? Sup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>posing
the Spirit of the age, that puts material well-being
before all other prizes of life, should carry the victory, supposing
the ideal of a perfect materialism should be realized, what then?
Cui bono?</p>

<p>Contrary to the Judeo-Christian highest ideal of protection
of the poor and disinherited, there is the brutal philosophy of
Nietzsche’s superman. While the former proclaims the sublimity
of abnegation in the interest of the present weak and
downtrodden, the latter preaches the extermination of these
weaklings in the interest of the future generations of supermen.</p>

<p>The vindictive vandal-like philosophy of Nietzsche demands
the destruction of the weaker by the stronger.<a id="FNanchor_DJ_114" href="#Footnote_DJ_114" class="fnanchor">DJ</a> In this way a
perfect aristocracy will arise. But the principle of a good aristocracy
must be not to exist for the sake of society, but only as a
foundation and scaffolding by means of which an elect kind of
being may arise to its higher tasks.</p>

<p>But what are the higher tasks? Here Nietzsche is perfectly
silent. What is the highest value, what is man’s standard of
values by which we may judge and measure the valuable? What
is the best for society? What are the greatest aims and ends
in life? Are the material gains of society of supreme value?
Is the building of railroads, telegraphs, telephones or factories
of supreme value, or are the ends of life the writing of lyrics,
painting of pictures, and the chiseling of statues? What will be
reached with the superstate of society? If the end and purpose
of human existence were known, we could decide whether it is
worth while to expend human energy upon the increase of
material well-being, whether it is preferable to conserve the
energy for the attainment of spiritual joys, or whether the
ethical efforts would be of the highest cosmic value. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
ultimate purpose being unknown, or even unknowable, what will
be reached when the superman has been produced? What is he
going to accomplish? What when the highest degree of accomplishment
has been reached in science, art, literature and economics,
what then? If all men were Aristoteles, Kants, Spencers,
if all women were Sapphos, Mme. de Staëls or George
Eliots, what then? Humanity would soon starve if it consisted
of Apollos, Venuses and intellectual giants only. A Venus was
not created to wash dishes, neither will an astronomer make a
proficient bricklayer or a poet a good shoemaker, Hans Sachs to
the contrary notwithstanding. The catch-phrase that society
nowadays wants not the man who is a good machine but the
man who can make one, sounds clever but is not true. The truth
is that for every machine invented, we need hundreds and
thousands of men to handle the same. A population consisting
of supermen only, such as inventors, captains of industry, professional
men, rulers, statesman, generals, poets, artists, etc.,
could not exist for any length of time.</p>

<p>The different brands of reformers claim that, following
their doctrines, it will lead to the highest advantage of humanity.
But they fail to give the definition of advantage. What is
the best for humanity? What is man’s purpose and aim in this
world? What is meant by the fulfilment of man’s destiny? The
answer is entirely meaningless, that the real aim is to be useful
in real life, and only begs the question. What is life, what is
it here for? Whence does man come, whither is he traveling?</p>

<p>What is the aim of civilization? All civilization is merely
an intense effort to make life beautiful. If life is trivial, then
civilization is vanity and vexation of the spirit. What profits
man to wear out body and mind in the service of civilization?
Civilization has been developed on a metallic basis. Tools, implements,
instruments and machinery form the landmarks of
the different civilizations. The gold of Ophir, the copper of
Sinai, the silver of Laurium were part of the web and woof of
the early civilization. In modern times industrialism has become
nearly the sum total of our civilization. The highest boast
of our present civilization is wireless, aeroplanes, telephones,
telegraphs, railroads, all mere facilities of living and communi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>cation.
If life is mere vanity, then all civilization or progress
is a figment.</p>

<p>Another kind of ethical valuation has been proclaimed by
the “moralists of work.” It has first found eloquent expression
in Zola’s so-called four evangelia, especially in ‘Le Travail’ and
in ‘La Fécondité.’ The sermon preached there is work for
work’s sake. The god worshiped is the god of things material.
Man is told to go forth with a high and noble purpose toward
the god of things. These new preachers of the morality of work
have almost succeeded to create a certain frenzy for work. The
success virus of things material is being steadily pumped into
men and even women, so that life has become simply a whirl of
things of no survival value whatsoever. The crude materialism
and realism of our times have created a feverish and almost insane
craving for things, a quenchless fever for things material.
The spirit of the hour is the material world-building, the lust
for material things, the intoxication of work.<a id="FNanchor_DK_115" href="#Footnote_DK_115" class="fnanchor">DK</a> Hence the high-pressure
requirements of modern existence which have created
in the people a total lack of proportion, a lack of all sense of
relative values. The relative value of a thing, representing its
power to relieve man’s wants, has become confounded with positive
values which only timeless things possess.</p>

<p>People labor and look forward; but what do they look
forward to? Our existence is so fleeting. One intangible fleeting
hour, and we drop into the hollows of oblivion. If the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
aim in life are material things, then the absurdity of life is
unquestionable. If life means anything at all, none of man’s
expressions of life can be an end in itself. If the only divinity
is the god of work, then the triviality of life, whether of the
life of the high or of that of the low, of the king or of the beggar,
is evident. What profit will accrue to humanity even if it
consisted of kings and princes only? If the future of man is
only a material well-being, there is no profit in struggling and
suffering for an aimless future. Granted that in this future
such fatalities of life, as sorrow, hunger, vice, prejudice could be
eliminated, granted that every man, woman and child will have
their equal shares in the great duties and privileges of life, will
such a life be less valueless and purposeless when death approaches?</p>

<p><i>Morality of love.</i>—While the three systems of conduct, just
mentioned, are founded upon certain ideals, even if they be the
ideals of materialism (paradox), the morality of a certain
school of modern writers has raised as its ideal the most perfect
egotism extant. This effeminate, fade species of literature proclaims
the absolute dictature of Eros as the new ethics. The
genius of propagation has deluded and beguiled these new
moralists to proclaim their intoxication of sensuality as a new
religion of personality.<a id="FNanchor_DL_116" href="#Footnote_DL_116" class="fnanchor">DL</a> Their doctrine teaches that voluptuous
sensuality is the moral ground of sexual relations.<a id="FNanchor_DM_117" href="#Footnote_DM_117" class="fnanchor">DM</a> They
preach the all-importance of love as the last word of human
wisdom. Men should live for the physical desires, and in the
instincts of the moment. Man ought to ignore every thing that
is not wholly material, he must strive to be a good animal. The
complete satisfaction of his desires, the dip into the vices and
pleasures of the senses, the plenary indulgences of the flesh, are
the primordial and ineffaceable rights of man. These individualists
simply deify passion. Their vulgar eroticism and
their constant erotic rumination, which fill their entire effeminate
literature, are covered with a veil of insipid verse. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
high-sounding phrases and glittering generalities, emitted by
these writers of the literature of futurism, poorly conceal the
true meaning of their religion of sensuality. A phrase that
expresses their belief in a heaven wherein men and especially
women will come into their own, really means wherein men and
women will be allowed to give their passions free rein. Nothing
but sensuality is meant by phrases such as spiritual attraction
or the soul’s complement. When such a feminist proclaims to
the world that “woman wishes to cease to be a subject and longs
to be considered a human being,” she really means that every
sensual excitement she awakens should be taken seriously.</p>

<p>This new ethics is a mixture of self-deception, arrogance,
sensuality and irresponsibility. In their works these realists
reveal their cold, absolutely surfeited, caring for nothing. They
measure a man’s strength not by the power to subdue but by the
weakness of being subdued by passion. They preach that there
is no merit in self-control, sex-repression, generosity, service,
and proclaim that man’s unpardonable sin is that of denying
his nature, his greatest crime against life is the rigid repression
of the blood. They know of nothing holier than the sumptuous,
sensuous, time-worshipping world of paganism. All their writings
are replete with unending thrills and climaxes, all taken
from the domain of sex. Their gaze roves in voluptuous quest
over the nudity of erotic sin and social transgression.</p>

<p>Such high-sounding phrases as “live to fulfill your nature,
profess the faith of life, or woman’s desire for self-expression,
her desire to live and find her true destiny” crope out everywhere
in their writings and only serve to befuddle weak minds.
What does self-expression, nature, destiny, mean in the mouths
of people, drunk with the ravages of sensual pleasure? What
will it profit to these apostles of sensuality, when they have fulfilled
their nature, when they have found their destiny? At the
hour of death they hold in their hands only the ashes of spent
fancies.<a id="FNanchor_DN_118" href="#Footnote_DN_118" class="fnanchor">DN</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<p><i>Philosophy of pleasure.</i>—Another philosophy of life akin to
the morality of love is the philosophy of pleasure or rather of
happiness. The partisans of the hedonic philosophy proclaim
the sole reason of man’s existence is to procure the greatest possible
amount of happiness in this world.</p>

<p>Now in a certain respect, this is quite true. The ultimate
appraiser of all relative values is the promotion of happiness.
The hedonic is the supreme test of terrestrial values. The motive
for most of man’s actions is the desire for happiness. All
advances of humanity, the ethical, the artistic, the scientific and
especially the material, have contributed to the enhancement of
human welfare. Civilization means the victory of man over
nature, in the interest of the greatest good to the greatest
number. Culture is the pursuit of happiness of humanity.
Progress means the advance towards a higher and higher level
of humanity’s well-being. Commerce, industry, art and science
must enhance the welfare of human society. Social ends cannot
be served unless they tend to the gratification of the desire
for happiness. In all dreams of a future utopia, human welfare
and happiness is the goal. But is it possible that the attainment
of happiness and of the fleeting transitory joy shall be
the only purpose of life? The philosophy of pleasure allots to
man not only the right but also the duty of making his attainment
of happiness the only aim of his life. All law, custom,
and ethics, the three spontaneous regulators of the species<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span> “man,”
are claimed by this philosophy to exist for the sole purpose to
plane the road that leads to happiness.</p>

<p>But if this be true, if the value of life be only hedonic, if
the sole and only meaning of life is to enjoy and die, then man’s
existence is mere vanity. Then the community, nation, race and
humanity have no positive value. Civilization is a failure,
progress is worthless, and all our virtues are only the aberrations
of the spirit. This is the pessimism in which all philosophies,
that proclaim the hedonic to be the only aim of existence,
must end and actually do end.<a id="FNanchor_DO_119" href="#Footnote_DO_119" class="fnanchor">DO</a> But if life has no
meaning at all, if everything is, as Heine sings,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Fantastic, aimless is my song</div>
  <div class="verse">“As love, as life, as creator and creation.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>mere vanity, whence this will to live, this most deep-seated part
of our being, this unparalleled tenacity to life, manifested in
the lowest plant to the highest animal. There must be something
behind this will to live, something behind this tenacity
not only of the individual’s life, but of the life of future generations.
If the only end in life are joys that know no bounds,
whence comes the emotion that causes men to die for an abstract
principle, such as honor, truth, liberty, justice, etc.?
Who has implanted in man this spirituality, this will to work
for a future he knows not?</p>

<p><i>Moral standard in nature.</i>—Behind the tenacity of every
organic being to life must be searched the standard of morality,
behind this tenacity must lie the will of the First Cause, of the
Supreme Intelligence. The place to look for the will of the
Creative Power is, therefore, nature. But the philosopher must
not look only in one part of nature, insensate or irrational
nature, but in entire nature, human nature included.</p>

<p>It was the trick of the ages for the philosopher, high up
on a pedestal, to discuss the immutable laws of irrational nature
in the cosmos, without including the rational philosopher himself
as a part of nature. It was “Hic homo, hic natura.”</p>

<p>The truth of evolution has swept away for ever this kind
of sophistry. Evolution teaches unity in nature. The mineral,
vegetable and animal kingdoms are composed of the same elements.
The transition from one kingdom into another is
almost imperceptible. There is no line to be drawn between
living and non-living matter. Botanists and zoologists are often
at a loss to determine to which kingdom certain specimens be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>long.<a id="FNanchor_DP_120" href="#Footnote_DP_120" class="fnanchor">DP</a>
There is unity in nature, and man is no less an integral
part of nature than the air or the stars.</p>

<p>Now, man is a rational being. Hence an integral part of
nature is rational, and there is rationality in nature. If a
thousand millions of human brains, or a thousand million kilograms
of brain-matter on our planet possess intelligence, reason,
wisdom, judgment, memory, foresight, mind and ideas, then
there is rationality in nature. Even if this rationality is now
only perceivable in the human brain, it must, eons ago, have
been present in potentiality in the primordial cell, which developed
into the human brain, the flower of organic life. Nay,
rationality must have transcended the primordial cell. “The
soul, or the power of judgment, being the factor that makes
experience possible,” says Bergson, “cannot be a complex of experience
only, it transcends experience.”</p>

<p>The soul, mind and body become a unity in man, a trinitarian
unity, a “Dreieinigkeit.” There is interdependence between
the physical and the mental. The higher psychic centres
are dominated and domineered by the lower, or vegetative
centres. But two things, mutually dependent, are not for that
matter equivalent. The subtle and delicate influences by which
soul and body affect each other do not make them identical.
The mind which includes intellect and emotion is something
entirely different from the brain-cell. The action between mind
and brain-cell is absolutely unknown to us.</p>

<p>Everything tends to show that there is an intelligence behind
the creative energy in the world. All nature is in motion, in
vibration, in harmony. Five hundred millions of stars, all flaming
suns, whirling through space and carrying along with them
systems of planets and satellites, can not do so without a directing
intelligence. The universe must be supported by a principle,
immanent or transcendent. Human logic, which itself is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
transcendental, forces every real thinker to acknowledge wisdom
in nature. Natural, immutable laws do not explain the harmony
of things, which the soul, tuned to the high, distinctly
perceives. Who was the legislator of these laws but a transcendental
intelligence? Besides, there is an infinite beyond of
which gravitation is a puzzle. No man can imagine a limit
beyond which there is nothing; on the other hand, nobody can
imagine the infinite in time and space, things going on and on
without end. Both are inconceivable, still one must be true.</p>

<p>The feeling of extension and duration must hence be transcendental
in man, for it is entirely independent of reason. Reality
itself—Das Ding an sich—is inconceivable by reason and is
transcendental. The very idea of a thing is transcendental and
eternal. “The logos, or the logical axiom,” says Bergson, “is
eternal. The logical essence of a circle, e. c., the possibility of
drawing a circle, is eternal and infinite. It has neither place nor
date; for ‘Nowhere,’ at ‘No moment’ has drawing a circle begun
to be possible.”</p>

<p>If reason and all its attributes are transcendental and
eternal, then reason can only be a part of a larger reason. From
nothing comes nothing. If there were no reason in the nature
of the universe, whence did the primordial cell, which eons later
developed into the brain of an Aristoteles, Kant, Spencer, get
its reason? Whence do emotions, such as philanthropy and
pity, honor and sense of duty, justice and love of truth, and all
other ethical values come from? What is it that comprehends,
feels, loves, wills, hopes, fears? It is the soul in man, a part
of the Intelligence in the Universe, which Hinduism calls Trimutri,
Judaism designates as Jehovah, and Christianity terms
Logos. All these different names mean one and the same thing,
i. e., the transcendental intelligence behind the universe, of
which man is the conscious part of the scheme.</p>

<p>Hence the philosopher looking for the will of the Supreme
Intelligence, will have to return to nature, and especially to
human nature. For as Protagoras cogently once said: πάντων
χρημάτων μέτρον ἄνθρωπος, “man is the measure of all things.”
Now, what does nature will? We find in organic nature excessive
production and wholesale destruction. The abundance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
the reproductive cells in plant and animal is simply amazing.
Every ejaculation in man contains two or three hundred million
spermatozoa, each one of them sufficient for impregnation. Each
ovary of the new-born baby girl contains about thirty thousand
ova, each potentially a human being. The first effort of growth
is to set aside a part of the germ itself for future reproduction,
so that the germ may be indefinitely multiplied and handed
down to untold generations. The reproductive cells, the cells
which have not lost the primary power of multiplication, are
of the first consideration; the specialized cells, or the somatic
cells which cannot reproduce any longer, are of secondary importance.
Nature’s sole solicitation is the race. The supreme
law of organic nature is the preservation of the kind. Her sole
aim is the perpetuation of the species, hence the abundance of
the germ-plasm in plant and animal. Nature takes no chances.
She secures the continuance of the kind by the extravagant production
of material and the ruthless destruction of all that is
superfluous. Nature preserves the individual until it has
brought forth its offspring, after the message is delivered, the
messenger is discharged. Nature has no regard for the individual.
The fly is destined as a prey to the spider, the spider to
the swallow, the swallow to the hawk, the hawk to the eagle, and
the eagle to the hunter. But what is the hunter’s destiny?</p>

<p>Here nature is silent. The crown of creation seems to be
here for no purpose. Man seems to have no value whatever.
The individual does not count, it is created to be destroyed.
Nature is careless of the single life. The individual may
wither, the race is more and more.<a id="FNanchor_DQ_121" href="#Footnote_DQ_121" class="fnanchor">DQ</a> Everything that serves to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
improve the race is in harmony with nature. But to what purpose
is the race here? Cosmic nature owes us the answer. But
when we return to a certain part of nature, the conscious part
of nature, human nature, we find the hints for the reason of our
existence. It is the experience of the divine urge of progress
and the certainty that the crown of altruism is of the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
value in life. Both these qualities are transcendental, bestowed
already upon the primordial cell by the creative power of the
universe. Self-sacrifice resides in every cell. In every drop of
pus millions of dead white corpuscles, or cells can be seen who,
in the defence of the colony or the human body, sacrificed themselves
in the struggle with the invading bacteria. This cellular
self-sacrifice has developed in man into the impulse to serve
others, the inner possession of every human heart.</p>

<p>Altruism becomes thus the criterion of morality. There is
no morality for him who lives in solitude, there is only right
conduct. Morality is bound up with altruism, which on the
highest scale of moral development overcomes egotism. Man
feels then a moral obligation within himself to serve others in
the face of human need, of hunger, thirst, loneliness, nakedness,
sickness, etc. This obligation is felt in obedience to Kant’s
categorical imperative. The moral feeling is a part of man’s
life, it is transcendental. Morality and character are functions
of the brain like memory or imagination. The essence of
morality is as unexplainable by mechanical laws as the nature
of life itself. The creative power that gave life to man implanted
in him moral aspirations of the whole soul. The moral
law is hence based upon human feeling. What the throbbing
heart of the best of humanity considers right is the will of the
Supreme Intelligence, and hence the moral law. Human feeling
and human longing are the basis of every moral action.
When it is agreed among the best men, everywhere, and in every
epoch, that altruism is noble and that egotism is ignoble, then
altruism is the foundation of morality. The larger the altruistic
circle is, the praiseworthier it is. To benefit one’s family is
laudable, but a service rendered in the interest of the community,
of the nation, or of the human race, is far worthier.
The highest degree of morality is hence reached in actions
rendered in the interest of the race.</p>

savagery, when men still lived in hordes, mankind lived in a
state of “promiscuous” intercourse like the gregarious animals.
All the males of the horde protected the females and their offspring.
In the prehuman period, when horde-life was not yet
known, the semi-human creatures must have lived in pairs,
where every male protected his female and her offspring. Without
this protection the race would have died.</p>

<p>2) In the second stage the irregular state was abandoned
and the “consanguineous family” developed. It was founded
upon intermarriage of brothers and sisters, own or collateral, in
a group. Marriage between parents and children, as in the preceding
stage, is now decreed immoral and is prohibited.</p>

<p>3) In the third stage the prohibition of intermarriage in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
the same clan was decreed. Experience has taught even these
primitive men that the offspring of consanguineous marriages
were often deficient and degenerate. The prohibition of intermarriage
in the same clan excluded own brothers and sisters
from the marriage relations, or, in other words, incest is now
considered immoral. This so-called “punaluan family”<a id="FNanchor_DS_123" href="#Footnote_DS_123" class="fnanchor">DS</a> was
founded upon intermarriage of several sisters, own or collateral,
with each other’s husbands, in a group, the joint husbands not
being necessarily kinsmen of each other, but all belonging to
other tribes than their joint wives, or of several brothers with
each other’s wives, in a group. In this so-called exogamous<a id="FNanchor_DT_124" href="#Footnote_DT_124" class="fnanchor">DT</a>
marriage each group of men were conjointly married to the
group of women. Adultery was as yet unknown. The children,
in all these three stages, could only know their mother. Inheritance
follows in the female line, and gynocracy or matriarchate,
the government by women, prevails. The common mother of
the clan is the origin and ruler of the same.</p>

<p>4) In the fourth stage communal marriage is replaced by
the “pairing family.” It is founded upon the marriage between
single pairs, but without an exclusive cohabitation. The marriage
is continued during the pleasure of the parties. Marriage
between any relatives is entirely prohibited and considered
immoral. Hence marriage in a group is now impossible.
Marriage is still exogamous. The male leaves his clan and marries
into another clan. When he dies, his personal property,
which consisted of his arms and dress, is handed over to his
former clan. The main fortune remains in the clan of the wife.
The children may now know their father, yet they belong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
to their mother’s clan. Communistic housekeeping prevails
throughout the whole clan. Matriarchate is still in force. The
woman is still the undisputed mistress of the house and clan.
The males have only to provide the clan with food from day to
day, by hunting and fishing, and to fight the clan’s battles in
its protection. Property and descent go in the female line,
and kinship is counted through the mother.</p>

<p>5) During the fifth stage sources of wealth, hitherto unthought
of, develop by the training of animals and the breeding
of herds. The males, who have hitherto always been the providers
of food for the clan, are consequently the possessors of
the herds, which now form the main source of subsistence. Lest
with the death of the man, his property, the flocks, should be
handed over to the former clan, change of descent from the
female to the male line is established. The man is now the
ruler. The common ancestor, formerly only the leader in war,
is now the head of the clan and manager of its possessions.
Apart of the head other leaders were necessary in the frequent
wars. The latter become preeminent among the other members
of the clan and receive individual allotments from the common
wealth of the clan.<a id="FNanchor_DU_125" href="#Footnote_DU_125" class="fnanchor">DU</a> With the growth of their influence these
allotments ripen finally into individual ownership and are inherited
by the children.</p>

<p>6) The progress during the sixth stage was caused by the law
of inheritance. Inheritance in the male line requires that the
father should know his child. The strictest fidelity of the wife
is, therefore, a condition sine qua non, her faithfulness is of the
greatest racial importance. The woman no less than the man
was interested in female purity, in the interest of her children.
This strict fidelity, exacted from the wife by men and women
alike, leads to the ‘patriarchal family’ as found in the Bible. It is
founded upon the marriage of one man with one or more wives.<a id="FNanchor_DV_126" href="#Footnote_DV_126" class="fnanchor">DV</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

<p>Now, polygamy is a physical impossibility. Where no
man or woman remains unmated, general polygyny or polyandry
is practically impossible. The number of the two sexes is nearly
equal. If infanticide is not practiced (male infanticide has
seldom been practiced, except in Egypt, Exod. I, 16), and war
captives or slaves are not available, the general public must be
content with one mate.<a id="FNanchor_DW_127" href="#Footnote_DW_127" class="fnanchor">DW</a> Polygyny in this way led to “monogamy,”
founded upon marriage between single couples with
an exclusive cohabitation, as is now the rule in most of the
civilized nations.</p>

<p><i>Female chastity.</i>—All the changes in the marriage relations
of the sexes were thus made out of altruistic motives, in
the interest of the progeny with the sacrifice of personal comfort.
Promiscuity, consanguineous marriage, punaluan family,
and the pairing family followed each other in the interest of
the health of the offspring. The last change to female monogamy
was made in the economic interest of the progeny. The
husband in sacrificing his own comfort, while providing food
and shelter for his children, must be certain that he is the
father of these children. Uncertainty would make him negligent,
and the existence of the race would be jeopardized.<a id="FNanchor_DX_128" href="#Footnote_DX_128" class="fnanchor">DX</a></p>

<p>Adultery on the part of the husband does not necessarily
alter the relations of the children to the parents and each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
other; unchastity of the wife, however, either altogether breaks
the family bond or weakens it through doubt. The purity of
the woman and her faithfulness are, therefore, of the greatest
racial importance, and it is eminently proper that she should
be in the van of moral progress. The highest moral character,
says Kant, is that which does the good not out of inclination
but from a sense of duty guided by reason, and there is good
reason for female chastity.<a id="FNanchor_DY_129" href="#Footnote_DY_129" class="fnanchor">DY</a></p>

<p>In the lowest savage life the woman was free and even
the ruler. At that time not the remotest vestige of the idea of
chastity was to be found. The gratification of the instinct was
simply a natural process that contained in it neither good nor
evil. The jewel of chastity had no more value than a grain of
sand. For ages the sentiment of chastity had no existence.
Fornication, adultery and incest were the common order of
things, accepted by public opinion and even consecrated by religion.
Later on, chastity was known, not as a virtue but as a
necessity. But the severe punishment to which the wife was
subjected for her transgressions from the straight path of
chastity has led to the constant inculcations at home and in the
community that impurity in the woman is unholy, hated by God
and most infamous. These constant inculcations have created
such a strong sentiment of female purity that the old philosophers
maintained that it was an innate instinct, always present
under normal conditions.</p>

<p>When the spotless purity of the wife was once accepted as
the moral law of the race, it was of vital importance for her
that the man should also be limited to one permanent mate.
She had to place obstacles in his way of finding gratification of
his sensual desires elsewhere except with a permanent mate.
To accomplish her purpose, general female chastity was of the
greatest help to her. Strict female chastity is the best means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
to preserve the man’s fidelity. This fact is at the bottom of
woman’s hatred for her lax sister. She never forgives the
woman who lowers the value of feminine favors. If men can
find gratification of their desires for a little money on the
streets or for a small gift among his female acquaintances, all
the obstacles that chaste women have devised for many centuries
become futile and are of no avail. Hence woman hates her
fallen sister relentlessly. The law of obstacles is at the bottom
of the restrictions women have themselves imposed upon their
sex. After chastity in the wife has been dictated to her by
economic reasons, woman has been forced to develop her moral
standard. Her sexual passivity comes to woman’s aid in maintaining
her purity. It makes it easier for her to refuse a man’s
advances than it is for him to curb his passions.<a id="FNanchor_DZ_130" href="#Footnote_DZ_130" class="fnanchor">DZ</a></p>

<p>The law of obstacles has also created modesty and coyness,
the twin sisters of chastity. To increase the obstacles to men’s
advances, the woman imposed upon herself great restraint when
in men’s company. All the exterior modesty which women require
in expression, dress and behavior of their sex is to be explained
by the desire to increase the obstacles. Feminine coyness
prolongs the period of courtship. By keeping the suitor
in suspense and doubt the imagination and the sentimental side
of love are developed.<a id="FNanchor_EA_131" href="#Footnote_EA_131" class="fnanchor">EA</a></p>

<p>Modesty and coyness, though appearing to be natural and
inherited sentiments, are nothing more than natural obstacles
that tend to increase the value of the favor granted. Woman,
for this reason, watches not only over her own modesty, but is
anxious also to protect the modesty of her sister. She watches
with jealous eyes that feminine modesty should not be offended
in any way. She is ever ready to succor her sister with all her
means, in confinements, at accidents or in cases of sickness
where the presence of men might offend feminine modesty.<a id="FNanchor_EB_132" href="#Footnote_EB_132" class="fnanchor">EB</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

<p>Honor and virtue in woman did not originally take their
rise from any innate moral sense,—for a religious rite or a
legal form even to-day mark for her the whole difference between
irredeemable sin and absolute duty,—but from the mode
of her position and in accordance with the conditions of her
relation to men.<a id="FNanchor_EC_133" href="#Footnote_EC_133" class="fnanchor">EC</a> Her morality is founded rather upon the
rule of reason which is the best judge of duty. Woman’s modesty
and coyness are nothing else but reason applied to human
actions and regulating man’s appetites, desires and affections
for the good of the family, community, nation and of the
human race.</p>

<p>Thus the fascinating details of the evolution of the marriage
relations among men teach the lesson that the strong sentiment
of chastity, this powerful moral law that controls human
actions as the law of gravitation rules the world, has grown
slowly from microscopic beginnings until it has assumed a racial
consciousness which underlies that of the individual. Throughout
the three periods of the history of mankind—savagery, barbarism,
and civilization—the human heart felt a law within,
written by the strong hand of the Creator, that man has to sacrifice
personal comfort and freedom of action in the interest of
posterity, and that it is preferable to suffer the pain of repressed
passion and to bear its trial in the interest of that general
morality which our conscience tells us to be of such fundamental
value.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />

<small>MALE CHASTITY</small></h3>


<p>The history of the evolution of marriage furnishes the
reason for woman’s chastity. The purity of the wife and her
faithfulness are of the greatest racial importance. Chastity has
been forced upon her in a just and laudable cause, not by men<a id="FNanchor_ED_134" href="#Footnote_ED_134" class="fnanchor">ED</a>
but by economic conditions. When the moral law once had been
established restricting the wife to a permanent mate, she had to
place obstacles, in the form of general chastity, modesty and
coyness, in the way of man’s finding gratification of his sensual
desires elsewhere except with a permanent mate.</p>

<p>Now, is there a racial reason why men should be as chaste
as women? There are two valid racial reasons why in the interest
of posterity men should be held to as strict a form of
chastity as women are. The two reasons are the “Spirocheta
pallida” and the “Gonococcus,” or in other words, “syphilis” and
“gonorrhoea.”</p>

<p>Of the triad of venereal infections, “chancroid” (chancroid
may produce extensive ulcerative processes and mutilate the
sexual organs), “syphilis” and “gonorrhoea” the two latter are
of the greatest menace to the continuation of the human race.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
Especially gonorrhoea is undermining the vital forces of humanity,
on account of its wide spread among men.</p>

<p>Neisser, the discoverer of the gonococcus, claims that of the
adult male population inhabiting large cities only an insignificant
proportion escapes gonorrhoeal infection.<a id="FNanchor_EE_135" href="#Footnote_EE_135" class="fnanchor">EE</a></p>

<p>The reason of the spread of gonorrhoea is the mistaken idea
that gonorrhoea is a local trouble. Even among the educated
people who have had the best opportunities of education and
refinement, there are very few who know that gonorrhoea, once
acquired, may remain latent for years and still be the means of
infecting an innocent wife and destroying the eyesight of her
child. The so-called cure of gonorrhoea is not seldom only the
establishment of toleration of the presence of the gonococcus on
the part of the individual’s urethra. But the imperceptible discharge
still remains virulently contagious to the healthy virginal
genito-urinary passage of the young wife and to the delicate
tender conjunctiva of the new-born baby.</p>

<p>The non-multiplying gonococci, which have apparently been
deprived of their power to cause suppuration any longer at the
point of the first infection, may possess full virulence and also
the capacity of producing suppuration if transferred to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
other mucous membrane, especially in the virginal vulva,
urethra, Bartholinian glands, cervix, tubes, ovaries and peritoneum
of the newly-married wife.<a id="FNanchor_EF_136" href="#Footnote_EF_136" class="fnanchor">EF</a></p>

<p>Even if the non-multiplying gonococci should remain inactive
in the female genital tract in the beginning of married
life, they may do a great deal of damage later on. Gonococci
may remain in the genital tract during the entire period of
pregnancy, without clinical manifestations, and yet become
active during the puerperium, which explains many obscure
cases of puerperal infection. In this way the ignorance of the
prolonged infectious character of latent chronic gonorrhoea has
ruined many and many a young wife. The individual considers
himself cured, while in fact the gonorrhoea remains contagious
for many years to the innocent wife and her child.</p>

<p>The disease is markedly accentuated in virulence and danger
in the wife and mother in fulfilling her marital and maternal
functions, and the results of the disease are appalling. Eighty per
cent. of the deaths from inflammatory diseases, peculiar to women,
seventy-five per cent. of all special surgical operations performed
on women, many of them serious desexing operations, and sixty
per cent. of all the work done by specialists in diseases of
women are the result of gonorrhoea. Besides the numerous
fatal operations in the wake of gonorrhoea of the urogenital
tract, septicaemia or pyaemia may sometimes develop, which, as
a rule, lead to death.</p>

<p>The so-called one-child sterility is accounted for, in a
large measure, by the extension of a preexisting gonorrhoeal
infection during the puerperium. In this way fifty per cent.
or more of all the infected women are rendered sterile, in ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>dition
many are condemned to a life-long invalidism. The
aspirations, centred in motherhood and children, are thus swept
away.</p>

<p>Besides mutilating the innocent women, gonorrhoea destroys
the eyesight of innocent babies. From seventy to eighty
per cent. of the ophthalmia, which blots out the eyes of babies,
and fifteen to twenty-five per cent. of all blindness is caused
by gonococcus infection. In the passage of the child through
the infected maternal parts, the conjunctiva becomes, as a rule,
infected, and the danger of blindness is imminent.<a id="FNanchor_EG_137" href="#Footnote_EG_137" class="fnanchor">EG</a></p>

<p>Besides this danger of infecting the innocent mother and
child, gonorrhoea is not such an innocent disease even for the
man himself. It is not a local disease only, it is a general infection
and its manifestations may be as grave to the individual
as syphilis. The infection may ascend to the urinary passages
and cause a catarrh of the bladder and an infection of the
ureters and kidneys. It may affect the genital organs, as the
testicles and prostate in men, and uterus and tubes and ovaries
in women. The germs of gonorrhoea may enter the blood and
attack the joints. (Osier says: In many respects gonorrhoeal
arthritis is the most damaging, disabling and serious of all the
complications of gonorrhoea.) The germs may also enter the
heart and cause endocarditis and they may invade the brain and
cause meningitis and myelitis.<a id="FNanchor_EH_138" href="#Footnote_EH_138" class="fnanchor">EH</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span></p>

<p><i>Syphilis.</i>—The other most appalling venereal disease is
syphilis. The constitutional disturbances caused by syphilis
and the risks to the offspring make this disease one of the most
dreaded affections known to medical science. Even the primary
infection may become disastrous to the man and woman. Still
the acute stage, but for its contagiosity, would be of secondary
importance. Syphilis is essentially a chronic disease. The
duration of the disease is unlimited. It may remain latent
for years and then break out, either in form of chronic inflammations
or in form of syphilitic tumors or gummata. Fournier
found during the tertiary period of syphilis, as late as in the
tenth year after the primary infection, mucous papules in the
mouth and in the vagina, which had recently reappeared. This
shows that even during the tertiary stage syphilis may become
a source of infection for others.<a id="FNanchor_EI_139" href="#Footnote_EI_139" class="fnanchor">EI</a></p>

<p>Syphilis plays an important rôle in the etiology of almost
every known disease. Syphilis spares no tissue or structure, it
affects every organ of the body.</p>

<p>In the alimentary canal and its accessory glands, syphilis
may cause cicatrical obstructions of the esophagus, affections
of the stomach and intestines and gummatous productions of
the rectum. The liver, and sometimes the pancreas are affected,
either in form of chronic syphilitic inflammations or in form of
gummatous nodules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The following case is very instructive. The patient, a young girl
eleven years of age, who for some time previously suffered from diabetes
insipidus, could not be aroused from her quiet sleep one morning. The
author saw the child at about 4 P. M. She was still quietly sleeping,
and no matter which means he applied to awaken her, going so far as
to burn the soles of her feet, she could not be aroused. The following
morning the author found the child sitting in bed perfectly well and
only awaiting his permission to go to school. The next morning the
child was found again in a comatous state from which she could not
be aroused by every known means. In this state she died the following
night.</p>

<p>At the autopsy, the author found a small nodule, of the size of a
large pea, on the left side of the dura mater, pressing upon the left
frontal lobe, and at the point of entrance of the vena portae he discovered
the liver turned into a grayish-looking mass of the size of a
child’s hand.</p>

<p>Both, the nodule of the dura mater and the liver, were taken to
the Pathological Institute, where the two tumors were found to be
syphilitic gummata. The child was suffering from hereditary syphilis.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the respiratory tract we find, in the first place, the
affections of the nose. The septum of the nose is often destroyed,
and the nose sinks in, in the form of a triangle. The
palate is sometimes destroyed already in the secondary stage,
and the patient’s speech is greatly impaired. The syphilitic
affections of the larynx cause extensive destructions of the organ
and a permanent impairment of the phonation. Deformities of
the trachea are not seldom the consequences of syphilis. Pneumonia
may also be caused by syphilis. Infiltrations of the
lungs are not such a rare occurrence. Gummata of the lungs
may undergo the destructive process, and cavities are formed
which are not infrequently diagnosed as tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The circulatory system is very often affected by syphilis, in
the form of arteriosclerosis. Gummata are sometimes found in
all the muscular parts of the heart. Syphilitic myocarditis and
sclerotic endocarditis are not rare. The syphilitic affection of
the ganglia and the nerves of the heart are the cause of different
forms of angina pectoris. The spleen and the other
blood-producing organs, the bone-marrow, are frequently the
seat of syphilitic manifestations. Pseudoleukaemia is often
caused by syphilis. The different aneurisms are often caused
by syphilis of the arteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<p>The genito-urinary system is especially affected by syphilis.
Apart from the initial affection, which is usually found at the
genitals, tertiary syphilis of the genital organs is not rare.
Syphilitic orchitis and gummata of the penis and testicles are
often observed. Gummata are also found on the external
genitals of women. The ovaries are often affected in form of
diffuse or gummatous oöphoritis. Syphilis is not seldom the
etiological factor of Bright’s disease.</p>

<p>The skeleton is also often affectedly syphilis. Besides the
bone-marrow, the bones themselves are especially subject to
syphilitic lesions. No joint escapes the attack of syphilis. The
most frequently affected joints are the knees and the elbows.</p>

<p>The muscles are affected by syphilis in form of an irritative
myositis and of chronic interstitial inflammations. Gummatous
infiltrations of the muscles are no rarity. The tendons are
affected in form of an acute irritative tendo-synovitis. Swelling
of the bursae is quite frequently met with in syphilitic
patients.</p>

<p>Syphilis of the nervous system is especially disastrous for
the patient. Syphilis not rarely causes cerebral and spinal
meningitis. Most of the tumors found in the brain are of
syphilitic origin and cause headaches, insomnia, flashing of
light before the eyes, vertigo, epileptic convulsions, a retarded
pulse, polyuria and polydipsia, and greatly affect the eyesight.
Gummata of the brain also cause aphasia, hemiplegia and
paralysis. Syphilis of the spinal cord manifests itself by heavy
weight of the extremities, neuralgia, paralysis of the muscles
and paresis of the bladder and rectum. The insanity caused by
syphilis may mimic every known form of mental derangement,
such as mania, melancholia, paretic dementia, locomotor ataxia
and general paresis.</p>

<p>Any of these terrible diseases may be the gift the young
wife receives from her infected husband in the wedding-night.
Still the danger from syphilis for the woman is by far less imminent
than that threatening her from gonorrhoea. No man,
except he be an idiot, would think of getting married while
still suffering from syphilis of the initial and secondary stages,
when the disease is highly infectious. During the latent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
tertiary stages the danger of infecting the wife is very slight
indeed. But there is no immunity for the offspring, during the
latent and tertiary stages.</p>

<p>The two venereal diseases are thus, each in its way, inflicting
the greatest suffering upon the innocent wife and child,
disrupting the family and causing the degeneration of the race.
There is no greater scourge devastating every nation to-day than
the two venereal diseases. No other disease has such a murderous
influence upon the offspring as syphilis, and no other
disease is so destructive to the health and reproductive function
of woman as gonorrhoea.</p>

<p>Thus the dangers of venereal diseases beset not only the
individual but through the individual the whole race. Both
venereal diseases respect no social position and recoil before no
virtue. They ramify through every class and rank of society.
Like “pallida mors” they approach with equal step the habitations
of the poor and the palaces of the rich.</p>

<p>With these dangers staring at him, no man has a right to
justify the double standard of sex-morality. No young man
should even think of exposing himself, his future wife and offspring
to all these dangers for the mere pittance of a short
momentary enjoyment in the company of the pestiferous individuals,
of these fallen angels whom the Bible describes as the
“strange woman which flattereth with her words, her feet go
down to death, her steps take hold on hell, going down to the
chambers of death.”</p>

<p>These meretricious women are constantly seeking those
whom they may devour and are laughing at the wholesale ruin
they are spreading. These unscrupulous courtesans are individuals
without industry, preferring indolent lives with a show
of finery and a brief period of gratification of their sensuality.
They indulge their selfish lust ad libitum, with no thought as
to what the result may be.</p>

<p>Most of the devotees of Venus vulgativa spend their brief
lives, trying to lead boys and young men into wickedness and
mischief. As a rule, they are all unclean and diseased and rejoice
to return to their partners, the so-called “prostituants,” the
infection they have received from other prostituants. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
young man, therefore, will in the majority of cases surely carry
away some foul disease from these women. When we consider
how difficult and rare a thing it is to thoroughly cure a woman
of gonorrhoea, it is easily understood how dangerous it is for
the youth to trust himself at any time in her subsequent life
within her infected presence.</p>

<p>Hence the youth have no right to become the main contributors
to the resources of the venal woman, whether of the
street or of the palatial home. Clandestine vice is, as a rule,
more dangerous in regard to contracting venereal diseases than
the immorality of the street. The majority of young men drift
into illicit, sensual life and its dangers and pitfalls without the
least physiological necessity. Until the age of twenty of the
woman and twenty-five of the man is reached, youth itself gains
by complete abstinence. The teens, says Ellen Key, should be
the age of the erotic prologue not of the drama. Premature
erotic claims are less the result of the needs of the organism
than the influence of the imagination upon it. The young boys
of sixteen to twenty-five are only in love with love. It is the
longing for love rather than love itself that renders them an
easy prey for the venal woman.</p>

<p>Masculine chastity must not, therefore, be laughed at. The
necessity of self-control and of chastity must be impressed upon
the mind of the young man as the only way to secure the
strong mental and physical qualities for the future paternal
relations.<a id="FNanchor_EJ_140" href="#Footnote_EJ_140" class="fnanchor">EJ</a></p>

<p>There is not the slightest shadow of support in any teachings
of physiology or hygiene for the double standard of
morality of the sexes. There is no reason why a moral wrong
in the woman should be a justifiable necessity with the man.
From no medical studies and investigations anywhere attainable,
would the physical necessity of sowing of “wild oats” for
a young man hold good. No one will deny that, as far as the
gentler sex is concerned, continence (at least between the age
of sixteen to thirty-five) is compatible with health, then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
general belief of young men that sensual indulgence is necessary
for healthy manhood, has no justification in physiology.
Purity is as little injurious to a man as to a woman. It is a
most absurd and erroneous teaching that, unless inclination is
gratified, a man’s health will suffer.</p>

<p>The instinct of generation has been compared with the instinct
of hunger and thirst, and as the latter must be satisfied,
so must the former be gratified. But there is no proper parallelism
between these two instincts. Food and drink are vital
necessities of the organism from the first day of conception, to
replace the stuffs consumed in the metabolism of the vital
functions. The generative instinct appears a number of years
after birth, hence does not serve any vital necessity. This instinct
could, if at all, only be compared with the instinct of
micturition or defecation, and the relief of the physical pressure
in the generative organs is brought about by the self-regulating
action of nocturnal emissions. It may be more
natural and agreeable for a healthy man and woman, after
they have reached a certain age, to indulge in the exercise
of their organs of generation at reasonable intervals, than to
abstain from it. But to proclaim that this abstinence, compatible
with health in women, is injurious to men, is sheer
absurdity.</p>

<p>It is especially hard to understand how any medical men
could recommend to a young man to resort to illicit relations
for health and to jeopardize his own health and that of his
future family. If it is justified to recommend illicit relations
to a young man, as a cure for masturbation and its resulting
neurasthenia, instead of explaining to him that a healthy hygiene
and the exercise of his will-power will make easy the control
of the desire without any loss of health, then why not
recommend the same remedy to young women. Continence is
no more injurious to the man than to the woman. The conventional
view that incontinence in men is a necessary condition
of health must be corrected. Instead of the popular fallacy
that a young man is physically the worse for a clean moral
life, the entire weight of evidence of the world’s foremost medical
scholars is unreservedly of the opinion that he is physically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
better for it.<a id="FNanchor_EK_141" href="#Footnote_EK_141" class="fnanchor">EK</a> It is recognized by the highest authorities that
continence is perfectly compatible with the most perfect health.
Chastity properly understood is health, it never does any harm
to mind or body.<a id="FNanchor_EL_142" href="#Footnote_EL_142" class="fnanchor">EL</a> It is the consensus of the opinions of most of
the great medical thinkers that it is not prejudicial to the health
of a man to keep his body clean until he has found a true mate
in life.<a id="FNanchor_EM_143" href="#Footnote_EM_143" class="fnanchor">EM</a></p>

<p>The boy who has just passed adolescence ought, therefore,
to learn that the injudicious premature use of the organs of
generation is prejudicial to his health and is beset with great
dangers.<a id="FNanchor_EN_144" href="#Footnote_EN_144" class="fnanchor">EN</a> There is a great distinction between puberty and
nubility, and the boy must learn to check his sensual impulses
until marriage which is not so very hard to accomplish.</p>

<p>There are enough sexual stoics in the world to prove by
practical experience that continence is not only possible but also
practicable. Caesar says of the ancient Teutons:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span> “Ante annum
vicesimum sextum feminis notionem habere inter res turpissimas
habeatur.” “It was considered one of the most shameful things
to have any relations with a woman before the twenty-sixth
year of age” (Bellum Gallicum). Yet no one will dispute that
the ancient Teutons were strong and healthy. These ancient
barbarians seem to have learned by experience that before this
time sexual maturity is not yet complete. The same thing was
found in modern times by Eulenburg (Zeitschr. f. Bekämpf. d.
Geschlechtskrankheiten, 1907, p. 194), that the combined statistics
teach that complete sexual maturity is reached by the
woman only after the twentieth year of age, and by the man not
before the twenty-fifth year.</p>

<p>Besides the historic proof there are daily examples which
show the compatibility of chastity with health at any age.
Many young men, engaged to be married, remain chaste for
long periods without detriment to their health, although often
living in continuous sexual excitement. Patients suffering from
venereal diseases abstain during long periods of treatment without
any impairment of their general health. Men remain chaste
and healthy during long periods when their wives are ill or
during the periods of confinements. Athletes, training for some
physical contest, remain in enforced continence and yet healthy.
Seafaring men are often continent for long periods without injury.
It is not known that the discoverers of the North Pole
have greatly suffered by their enforced continence.</p>

<p>These few examples tend to show that abstinence is not
detrimental to health. In fact, no other condition of life is
more thoroughly consistent with perfect mental and physical
vigor than absolute chastity. The instinct only needs to be
controlled. Continence is only a matter of habit. When the
young man has not been debased by vile practices, it is usually
a comparatively easy task to be continent and requires no extraordinary
efforts. Every year of voluntary effort, at chastity,
renders the task easier by force of habit.<a id="FNanchor_EO_145" href="#Footnote_EO_145" class="fnanchor">EO</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span></p>

<p>Hence when the young man has been taught the advisability
of sensual control, when the positive assurance has been
given to him that total abstinence can be maintained without
loss of power and when his fears of impairing his health have
been dispelled, he will exercise his will-power and refrain from
a departure from moral standards, especially when the dearth
of wholesome information regarding the dangers of such a departure
has been removed.</p>

<p>In large cities sensual control is made very hard for the
young man. The unfortunate phase of the life in a big city is
the early introduction of the youth to temptations and vicious
conditions. Vice is obtruding upon him at every nook and
corner. A vile so-called literature, a suggestive perverse art
and an obscene stage panders his sensual curiosity.</p>

<p>But because, forsooth, it is hard to control that does not
mean that he has to yield to temptation. It is true that the
sexual appetite may assume imperiousness, but only in a certain
class of men, in hereditary weaklings, whose imagination is constantly
fed by lascivious thoughts and sensual images.</p>

<p>But the cause of the unchastity of boys is not that they
become sensually mature earlier than they could judiciously
enter into matrimony, the trouble lies in the fact that boys
cannot see why they should abstain from a tickling amusement,
which in their opinion does nobody any harm. Herein lies the
greatest obstacle to continence. The youth does not know the
ethical why, especially in our modern times with its religious
laxity. The ethics of religion, even in its best days, had not had
the power to control sensual passion and to create total abstinence,
although religion, especially Christianity, has preached
the same for the last two thousand years. In modern times with
the almost divine worship of the personality of the individual
the religious motive for chastity seems to fail entirely.</p>

<p>Hence the ethics of evolution and the ethics of sex-hygiene
must be tried. If the theory of evolution is right, and the purpose
of our being in this world is to assert life, then the aim
of life can not be the single individual but the species, which
can only be preserved by the right offspring. The child or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
what is the same the family<a id="FNanchor_EP_146" href="#Footnote_EP_146" class="fnanchor">EP</a> will have to furnish the motive
for man’s continence. The importance of the chastity of women
to the family has been recognized from the earliest history. It
is now time to teach the man the importance of his chastity to
the family, state and nation. He has to know his responsibility
just as the woman knows hers. Rational chastity must be
founded upon the sentiment of human responsibility. The
average man in his heart does not acknowledge to himself that
there is any competent reason why he should control his passion
beyond the sentimental idea of the justice of men’s remaining
chaste if they require it of women. It must, therefore, be shown
to the man that there is also an important racial reason for him
to abandon promiscuous life.<a id="FNanchor_EQ_147" href="#Footnote_EQ_147" class="fnanchor">EQ</a></p>

<p>If it is shown to the young man, at a time when his heart
and mind are still in the thrall of the early and eternal poetry
of the race, that it is as important to humanity that he should
be chaste as it is for the woman to be pure, then he will refrain
from illicit indulgence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The following case is very instructive in this respect. A student
of philosophy at one of the greatest German universities who led a
promiscuous life like any other student, gave up such life immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
after reading Tolstoy’s Kreutzer-Sonate. For the first time, as he
expressed it, he saw the reason why he should be as chaste as he expects
his bride to be.</p></blockquote>

<p>This shows what a moral lesson may do even for him who
grew up to manhood without any sex-instruction. The young
man who has the desire not to be dominated or controlled by
sensual passions and propensities, requires settled principles, a
firm purpose, and a strong will. But if the training of his will-power
has begun from early childhood, thus effecting the needed
self-discipline, and if disgust against everything vulgar, as the
company of lax women, has been implanted in his heart, he will
find the means to get out of the way of vice and to avoid the
contamination by venal sensuality. The best means of vast importance
as occupying and consuming the sexual powers in a
substitute form are bodily and mental labors. These labors, as
a rule, are lulling to sleep sensuality.</p>

<p>If the control of the sex-reflexes is not cultivated, if the
training of the will is ignored, meretricious venery will surely
take hold of him and infect him, it being only a matter of time
when it happens. The young man will exercise continence if
he has been taught from early childhood that his sensual yearnings
must be restrained like his propensity to overeat, to overdrink
or to overexercise. Because a young man wants a thing
it is not necessarily good for him to have it. Man has little
right to satisfy his desire by unchastity, says Ellen Key, as he
has to satisfy hunger by theft.<a id="FNanchor_ER_148" href="#Footnote_ER_148" class="fnanchor">ER</a></p>

<p>If the young man has learned in time the responsibility
and duty of the man towards the woman, if he has been made
aware of the fact that one false step ruins the girl irremediably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
for her entire life, if his attention has been called upon the
serious consequences for the woman, such as pregnancy, motherhood
and social ostracism, he will not so easily ever try to
seduce an innocent girl. He will treat every woman he meets
with in life as he wishes his own sister or future wife to be
treated by others.</p>

<p>The young man has further to learn that every union of
bodies without the harmony of the souls is humiliating and immoral.
That does not mean that the idea should be imparted to
our youth that the sexual impulse is something low and bestial,
as some moralists would like us to believe. On the contrary, we
must teach our youth that a healthy and natural exercise of
the human organism is a precious blessing that must not be
squandered and recklessly defiled. We must teach the young
man that for the future offspring’s sake the monogamic marriage
is the only one which the ideal man will resort to. Until
his mate is found he will have to control his sensual desires.
The control of sensuality develops the deeper feelings of love.
Bought love kills the finest instruments of mental activity.
Promiscuity destroys the relations of the young companionship.
Free love leaves all the best human qualities undeveloped. To
form the healthy germ of society, marriage must be unitary and
permanent. The individual love assists the elevation of the
race. Monogamy was victorious from the experience of its advantages.
It exists for the sake of the race.</p>

<p>The race-enhancing form of union is a permanent monogamy.
From the physiological standpoint monogamic marriage
is a natural and healthful institution. It affords a free
outlet to sensuality without generally exhausting it by the unceasing
excitement in the presence of new objects. Novelty is
the chief stimulus to the sexual feeling and is the main cause
of overindulgence and its sequels. In centralizing affection
upon one person, marriage furnishes the greatest scope of its
development and expansion. Marriage favors the development
of a great number of faculties which otherwise would be in
danger of being abused. Marriage contributes to the general
morality of mankind by the regularity which it brings to all the
actions of life, by the calmness which it spreads over human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
existence, and by the harmony which it introduces into the
functional exercise of all our necessities. It creates in man a
greater attachment to life in helping to overcome a great number
of difficulties. Marriage, therefore, contributes to the
progress of humanity, and man is by duty bound that the selection
of a mate should contribute to the enhancement of the
human race. Every individual acquires duties towards the race.
The man or the woman who transgresses the path of strict
monogamy has done a disservice to humanity. From the point
of view of evolutionary ethics, men and women must make absolute
chastity the rule of their lives.</p>

The tendency of the mind is to project in imagination upon the
world about us what we possess in our own souls. An accentuated mental
attitude in an individual is, as a rule, proof that in its subconsciousness
dwells a type of reversed feeling to the one that is active in consciousness.
The excessive prude is generally at heart a sensualist.</p></div>

This quality may explain the Talmud’s (Berachoth 60a, Nidah
31) assertion that if the female orgasm occurs first, the child is of the
masculine sex, while when the male orgasm precedes that of the female,
a girl is born. When the male orgasm occurs first, the semen is discharged
within the acid vaginal contents. The spermatozoa are, therefore,
weakened, and a girl is born. When the woman’s orgasm occurs
first, the semen is then ejaculated into the alkaline cervical secretion
which was expelled with Kristeller’s plug. Hence, the spermatozoa
remain strong and vigorous and a boy is born. The modern theory of
sex is that it is determined by the germ-cells as every other unit character.
Every spermatozoön and ovum possess originally male and
female determiners. But during the maturition the determiners of one
sex are cast off, and the gametes are either male or female. Hence,
when the ovum is male, only a male spermatozoön will be admitted
within its interior, and a boy will be the result. If the ovum is female,
only a female spermatozoön will be able to penetrate it, and a girl
will be born.</p></div>

Explanatory remarks: When a voluptuary thought originates
in the centre of voluptas 11, it is transmitted by fibre 12 to the vasodilatory
centre 4 in the medulla oblongata, hence by fibre 14 in the
spinal cord to the centre of erection 16 in the lumbar part of the
cord; hence through the nervi erigentes 17 to the genitals at the
periphery 10, where it responds by an erection. The excitation of the
erection is then, if strong enough, transmitted through the centripetal
or sensory nerve 9 to the centre of ejaculation 7; hence again through
the centrifugal ejaculatory nerve 8 to the periphery, where ejaculation
takes place.
</p>
<p>
When an excitation originates at the periphery 10, as in sleep, it
is transmitted through the sensory nerve 18 to the centre of erection
16, and through nerve 15 to the vasodilatory centre 4; hence back to
the periphery by the nerves 14 and 17, after the inhibitory nerve 13
has been paralyzed. The excitation of the erection is then transmitted,
as previously described, through nerve 9 to centre 7 and nerve 8 to
the periphery where ejaculation takes place. In either case the excitation
of the ejaculation is then carried through the sensory nerve 5
to the centre of libido 3 and is there experienced as a pleasurable feeling.
</p>
<p>
When the centre of erection 16 is directly irritated, for example, by
electricity, after the spinal cord has been severed, the stimulus is directly
transmitted through nerve 17 to the periphery 10 to respond with erection.
The same road is taken by the excitation of the centre of erection
16 during sleep.
</p>
<p>
In spermatorrhoea the stimulus at the centre of voluptas 11 is
directly transmitted through nerve 6 to the centre of ejaculation 7,
hence through nerve 8 to the periphery 10, and ejaculation takes place
without erection.</p></div>

Many authorities (among others Rohleder, Berliner Klinik, 1909,
Heft 257) claim that the libido, or the pleasurable sensations, originate
at the orifices of the ejaculatory ducts during the passage of the thick
semen through these narrow openings. This hypothesis will not stand
a critical analysis. People who began to masturbate in early childhood
relate that for years they experienced orgasm without noticing the least
trace of an ejaculation. One day, usually between the fourteenth and
sixteenth year, they were surprised by the first ejaculation. Still there
was no material change in the quality of the libido during the orgasm
accompanied by ejaculation from that experienced during the previous
orgasms without ejaculations. This tends to show that the libido experienced
at the sexual paroxysm has its cause not in the removal of
the material congestion but in the relief from the nervous tension.
The orgastic paroxysm has its analogy in the epileptic crisis. The
nervous tension in the epileptic patient is gradually increased until
one day an explosion ensues, and the epileptic attack removes, so to say,
the accumulated nervous energy. The patient is then relieved for a
certain time. An analogous relief from the nervous tension is effected
during the orgastic crisis, and the cause of the libido in men and in
women is this discharge of nervous energy. The ejaculation of the few
drops of semen or of Kristeller’s plug is only an accidental incident,
which may contribute to the well-being of the individual, just as the
discharge from bladder and rectum, but which is not the cause of
orgastic libido.</p></div>

This monthly periodicity is attributed by some authorities to
cosmic influences (the new moon and full moon). But since other
vital processes also show a certain undulatory increase and decrease in
strength (e. c. the systole and diastole of the heart), it is more probable
that the periodicity of ovulation is due to an undulatory motion, where
the length of the wave is about four weeks.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_G_7" href="#FNanchor_G_7" class="label">G</a>
According to Pflüger (Veit’s Handb. der Gyn. 1908, Vol. 3, p. 25)
the pressure of the periodically growing Graafian follicle causes a continual
irritation of the ovarian nerves, which, by reflex action, is the
cause of the great congestion of the genitals. When the stimulus has
reached a certain height, the congestion leads, on the one side, to the
rupture of the follicle, on the other hand, to the menstrual change
of the uterine mucosa. This theory has been abandoned, and the modern
trend of opinion is to attribute the general congestion to chemical
substances, thus returning to Brown-Sequard teachings that the periodical
congestion is caused by a chemical substance which, produced
within the ovary, enters the blood circulation.
</p>
<p>
According to L. Meyer, under the influence of ovulation, a continual
production of substances, oophorines, necessary for the growth
of the foetus, takes place. These substances circulate in the blood,
and, when they are present in large amounts, cause a stimulation of
the entire nervous system. This explains the nervous irritation and
other phenomena of this period. During menstruation these substances
are excreted.
</p>
<p>
G. Klein (Münch. med. Wochenschr. 1911, p. 997) thinks that
the oophorines cause a chemical change of the uterine mucosa and of
the blood circulating in the latter, and are themselves chemically
changed. They then leave the body simultaneously with the menstrual
blood. Hence menstruation is a real catharsis, in the sense of Hypokrates,
a freeing of the body from the toxic effects of the oophorines.
The presence of the oophorines during this period accounts for the
different smell of menstrual blood from ordinary blood. The peculiar
smell from the mouths of some menstruating women may also be attributed
to the presence of the oophorines in the body.
</p>
<p>
When pregnancy has once been established, menstruation ceases
for the entire period the mother is nursing her offspring, be the nursing
within the uterus during gestation or later on during lactation, with
the breast. Both periods comprise the time when the mother has to give
her vital fluids for the nutrition of her offspring.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_H_8" href="#FNanchor_H_8" class="label">H</a>
The Hindus recommend the marriage of the girl before the first
menstruation has set in. Among many savages the first menstruation
is the signal for marrying off the girl. Such women become impregnated
with each succeeding child immediately after they have finished
nursing the preceding one. By the time propagation ceases, the climacerium
sets in. In this way these women only menstruate a few times
during their lives.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_I_9" href="#FNanchor_I_9" class="label">I</a>
Another reason why menstruation is so rarely observed among
animals is their posture. If the preparations preceding menstruation
are for the purpose of ingrafting the fertilized ovum, it follows that
menstruation must occur in all those animals in which the fertilized
egg is fully developed to complete maturity within the interior of the
mother. This is indeed what happens. All animals with so intimate
an attachment of the foetal and maternal organisms that the foetal
placenta cannot be detached from the mother without a haemorrhage,
show the phenomenon of menstruation.
</p>
<p>
Menstruation was formerly regarded as the exclusive prerogative
of woman, but we know now that woman shares the privilege with many
animals. All warm-blooded animals that stand or walk erect, without
exception, menstruate. The appearance of the discharge is simply due
to posture. The process is going on in all quadrupeds, as the sheep,
the cow, the dog, the cat, etc., but on account of the position of the
uterus (in quadrupeds the fundus of the uterus is situated lower than
the neck) the blood is usually retained in that organ, reabsorbed
through the lymphatics into the blood, and consumed in the vital process
or eliminated through excretory glands.
</p>
<p>
In some animals the discharge consists of mucus. In dogs the
writer saw real blood. It is only a play of nature, that in one species
the congestion of the genitals manifests itself by a sweating of viscous
mucus, in the other by a flow of blood.
</p>
<p>
Even the lower animals shed the same degenerated material. They
menstruate through the lymphatics, if for one cause or another impregnation
has been prevented. But as a rule, in animals, living in
freedom, impregnation always follows the preparation of the uterus,
and the phenomenon of menstruation fails to appear. It is only among
domesticated animals that the discharge from the genitals is sometimes
observed.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_J_10" href="#FNanchor_J_10" class="label">J</a>
According to Bischoff, at the moment of the highest excitement
the uterus is pressed down into the small pelvis, and the uterine orifice
opens and receives the sperma by a kind of suction.
</p>
<p>
Eichstedt claims that the uterus, which is usually flattened in
the sagittal direction, assumes a round, pear-shaped form during the
excitement and for some time afterwards. In this way a real cavum
uteri is produced, where previously only a virtual cavity existed. The
vacuity then sucks in the sperma by means of aspiration like a pump.
</p>
<p>
Kisch says: During the orgasm the uterus descends deeper into
the pelvis. It is assisted in its descent by the pressure of the abdominal
muscles. The muscles of the uterus open then the uterine
orifice, and the formerly flat opening becomes round. At the same
time the uterine orifices of the tubes also open. Simultaneously the
secretion of the cervical glands is expressed, and a suction of a small
amount of sperma into the cervix ensues.
</p>
<p>
Rohleder says: The plicae palmatae of the cervix form an obstacle
to the penetration of any fluid into the uterus. But during the excitement,
this obstacle is overcome by the increased secretion of the cervical
glands. At the same time the uterine orifices of the tubes, which
are generally closed, open widely through the excitement and almost
challenge the entrance of the spermatozoa.
</p>
<p>
Kristeller describes the secretion of a clear transparent mucus in
the form of a cord about one to four millimeters thick and one to six
centimeters long in the uterus of every mature woman, who never was
pregnant. This cord is hanging out of the orificium externum uteri.
</p>
<p>
According to Wernich, a preparatory erection of the vaginal
portion and of the neck of the uterus takes place in the beginning of
the act. Then in the moment of the highest orgastic excitement, and
almost simultaneously with the mutual ejaculation, the cervix becomes
flabby and soft again. This sudden relaxation of the erected cervix
is made possible by a particular arrangement of the nerves and causes
the aspiration of the sperma. The erection of the lower part of the
uterus during the sexual excitement has, therefore, almost the same
importance for propagation as the erection of the penis for copulation.
It serves the purpose of expelling Kristeller’s slimy plug from the
cervix, in the moment of the highest orgasm.
</p>
<p>
Mundé has seen the gushing, almost in jets, of clear viscid mucus
from the external os during evident sexual excitement, produced by
the rather prolonged digital and specular examination, in an erotic
woman. The lips of the external os alternately opened and closed, with
each gasping emitting clear mucus, until the excitement, which was intentionally
prolonged by gently titillating the cervix with a sound
through a Sims speculum, reached such a height as to cause the woman
to sit up on the table and thus end the experiment.
</p>
<p>
Beck (St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal, Sep. 1872, p. 449)
observed an orgasm while examining a woman with prolapsus uteri.
The orifice of the uterus was just inside of the vulva and could be
observed without a speculum. The woman was very prone, by reason
of her passionate nature, to have an orgasm produced at the slightest
contact with the fingers. The action of the uterus during the two
observations was almost identical. The cervix of the uterus had
been firm, hard, and generally in a normal condition, with the os
closed so as not to admit the uterine probe without difficulty. But
immediately when the orgasm began, the os opened to the extent of
fully an inch, made five to six successive gasps, drawing the external
os into the cervix, each time, powerfully and at the same time becoming
quite soft to the touch. After about twelve seconds all was
over. The os had closed again, and the cervix hardened. During the
crisis an intense congestion of the parts could be noticed. The sensations
experienced were described as being of the same quality as they
ever were during coition. But they were not the same in quantity, the
normal orgasm lasting longer.
</p>
<p>
Talmey (New York Medical Journal, June, 23, 1917) observed
an orgasm while examining a case where the cervix was found to
be of normal consistency, and the external os was just passable
for a uterine sound. Suddenly the cervix became red, congested, and
soft, and the sound within the uterine cavity began to execute certain
movements, resembling pendulum swings. The os opened so wide as to
admit the index finger besides the sound, and the cervical lips made three
gasps, each time drawing the lips within the canal. After a few seconds
the paroxysm was over.
</p>
<p>
These direct observations on the uterus by the last named American
authors place the uterine action during the orgasm into the realm
of scientific facts and entirely remove it from the province of theoretical
speculation. The fact has been established beyond the shadow of a
doubt that propagation is greatly facilitated by the suction-movements
of the uterus during the orgasm.
</p>
<p>
This suction is also the cause why douches which are often recommended
as anti-conceptional remedies must fail, even if they are made
immediately after congress. By the uterine suction the spermatozoa are
drawn within the uterine cavity and immediately removed from any
action the douches could have on them. Hence when the female orgasm
follows the male, as it usually does in the normal woman, anti-conceptional
douches will always be a failure. Only when the female
orgasm precedes that of the male, and the spermatozoa are left upon
their own resources to reach the uterine cavity, then there is a chance
to kill the spermatozoa by an immediate antiseptic, acid or bacteriocide
douche.</p></div>

According to Hammond the neck and mouth of the uterus are
supplied with sensibility in its character, like that possessed by the

the clitoris, and experience libido only by the touch of the walls of
the vaginal entrance. One of the author’s patients experiences a painful
sensation by the titillation of the clitoris, while the touch of the vaginal

Women, says Hagen, in his “Sexuelle Osphresiologie,” are like
the flowers who spread their intoxicating fragrance during dawn and
dusk—at the first rays of the rising and the last rays of the setting sun.
With some the sweetest odors emanate during night-time. Before a
thunder storm, when the air is close, the “parfum de la femme” is
particularly pronounced. The transpiration of lean women is less pronounced
than in the stout, who possess usually large sudoriparous
pores and sebaceous glands. Brunettes have a stronger odor feminae
than blondes, and both are surpassed by the red-haired.
</p>
<p>
According to Jaeger, the balmy fragrance of the pure, innocent
virgin is of an extraordinary purity. As soon as the girl falls in love,
the fragrance at once changes.
</p>
<p>
Long sexual continence is claimed by Galopin to increase the transpiratory
odor feminae.

The complicated actions, executed by the new-born baby at the
first nursing, are the most marvelous the author can imagine. As
soon as the mother presents her breast to her baby, its mouth closes
air-tight around the nipple, by the prompt action of the muscle orbicularis
oris (innervated by the facialis). Thereupon the tongue is
retracted like the piston of a syringe. In this way a vacuum is created
in the cavity of the mouth, and the milk is thus drawn out of the
breast. This retraction of the tongue is effected by the help of the
muscles hyoglossus and styloglossus.
</p>
<p>
The tongue is now pressed toward the palate, pushing the fluid
backward toward the pharynx. First the top of the tongue is pressed
to the palate by the M. longitudinalis linguae, then the middle tongue,
by lifting the hyoides bone by means of the M. mylohyoideus (N. trigeminus)
and finally the root of the tongue by the muscles styloglossus
and palatoglossus (N. facialis).
</p>
<p>
When the fluid has passed the two arcs, the arcus palatoglossus
and the arcus palatopharyngeus, the latter contract and close the way
back to the front, while the soft palate or uvula closes up the cavity of
the nose by the action of the M. levator veli palatini (facialis) and
the M. tensor veli palatini (trigeminus).
</p>
<p>
The fluid or the morsel is thus confined in the head of the pharynx.
The larynx is now drawn upward and forward by the Mm. geniohyoideus,
digastricus and mylohyoideus. In this way the root of the
tongue presses the epiglottis down upon the orifice of the larynx, and
prevents the food from entering into the lungs.
</p>
<p>
The food enters now the oesophagus which by a peristaltic movement
presses the same down into the stomach.
</p>
<p>
Arrived in the stomach, the epithelia of the latter begin to secrete
hydrochloric acid and pepsin by which the albumen of the food is changed
successively into syntonin, propeton, and pepton. By a peristaltic movement
of the stomach, the solution is then forwarded into the duodenum.
</p>
<p>
At the arrival there the pancreas sends its ferments, trypsin, to
dissolve the still unchanged albuminates, and the fat-ferment to break
up the fatty substances (the diastatic ferment for changing the carbohydrates
into sugar is not found yet in the infant). At the same time
the liver sends in its secretion, the bile, which serves to effect an
emulsion of the fatty substances. The other intestinal glands also
contribute their secretions to effect all these necessary changes, so that
the chyle can now be imbibed by the intestinal villi, by a kind of
osmosis, and forwarded into the lymphatic current to serve as nourishment
for the new-born individual.
</p>
<p>
Now, all these organs, the nerves, muscles, and glands, must work
in coördination and perfect harmony to accomplish the task of the
preparation of the young animal’s food. It would take a physicist and
chemist years of hard study to be able to accomplish all the different
tasks, just described, which the new-born baby is able to effect, without
any effort, in the first hours of its new existence.
</p>
<p>
This wonderful instinct of hunger for food and its satisfaction
is really awe-inspiring. It is an inexplicable mystery as life itself.
In fact, it is, as Bergson truly says, the prolongation of the life-principle.
The author is unable to agree with the last named philosopher, who
claims that intellect is the highest in men and instinct in the hymenoptera.
It seems to the author that the instinct of taking in food
and its preparation into chyle by man is no less wonderful than the
knowledge of the digger-wasp to sting the caterpillar just in the right
place to ensure paralysis without death.
</p>
<p>
The objection that all these actions are merely reflex-actions does
not detract an iota from the marvel. Then the coördination of all these
reflexes is miraculous. It only changes the name of instinct into
reflex, just as the change of the name of the creative power from the
old name of God into that of the atheist’s “Nature,” or of Plato’s
“idea,” or Nietzsche’s “Wille zur Macht,” or Bergson’s “Élan vital,” or
Shaw’s “Life force,” etc., does not in the least change the nature of
the creative power.</p></div>

Among animals, says Walker, there are species that never
marry and those that do. Those male animals whose young are easily
fed, such as the horse, the bull or the dog, never approach the female
except when under the influence of rut, never cohabit with one exclusively,
rarely, if ever, repeat the reproductive act with the same individual,
and commit the care of the offspring entirely to their temporary
mates.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_AB_28" href="#FNanchor_AB_28" class="label">AB</a>
In some animals the rôles are changed. The part of the female
in fishes, for instance, is ended when she has let fall the roe on the
spawning-bed, while the male swims constantly over this bed and
watches over the fertilized eggs against the attack of enemies until the
eggs have developed into new fishes.</p></div>

The error committed by the radicals is that they read human
history and neglect to read natural history. In the beginning of history
permanent mating was already abolished. Permanent mating was
a necessity only as long as the couples lived separated. When, however,
already before the dawn of civilization, mutual aid was added to self
aid, when for the sake of protection men began to live in herds, and
all the males had the responsibility to procure the food for the entire
herd, the individual father was released from such responsibility, and
there was no necessity any longer for permanent mating. The result
was promiscuity, as found by Caesar (Bell. Gal. v. 14), among the
Britons: “uxores habent deni duodenique inter se communes et maxime
fratres cum fratribus, parentesque cum liberis,” and by Strabo among
the Celts of Ireland: “καὶ φανερῶς μίσγεσθαι ταῖς τε ἄλλαις γυναιξὶ καὶ
μητράσι καὶ ἀδελφαῖς.” From promiscuity the sexual relations run
through a certain cycle of consanguineous marriage, punaluan family,
pairing family, polygamy back again to monogamy, as now practised
in most of the civilized countries. All these changes were made in
the interest of the progeny, although often unconsciously, just as the
growing affection of two lovers is, in reality, already the will for life of
the new individual which they could or might beget.</p></div>

When a man, for instance, is attached to a woman because of her
outward harmonious appearance, i. e., beauty, it means that she pleases
his sense of sight. If he is fascinated by her beautiful voice, then his
sense of hearing has been appealed to. When he falls in love by the
touch of her soft little hand, then his tactile sense has been excited.
The meaning of all such attachments is the desire to satisfy the senses.
Hence the love is sensual. For any of the five senses may be the
starting point of sexual desire.
</p>
<p>
The generative centre is in communication with the centres of all
the other senses and may be excited by them.
</p>
<p>
Certain odors occasion pleasurable sexual feelings. The love of
sensual women for perfumes indicates a relation between the olfactory
and the sexual centres.
</p>
<p>
The sense of taste is sometimes in the service of sexuality. One
of the author’s patients had sexual sensations of a pleasurable character
when eating liver-sausages.
</p>
<p>
The sight of a beautiful specimen of the other sex, or even its
picture only, may frequently excite the sexual centre.
</p>
<p>
Emotional persons are often sexually excited by certain music. An
exaggerated fondness for music is always suspicious of being of a sexual
nature.
</p>
<p>
The tactile sense is the main sense in the service of sexuality.
The touch of any part of the male body by a soft female hand will
cause sensual excitement. The touch of the nipple in woman often
causes intense libido, a fact which plays an important part in
the nursing of the young throughout all the types of mammals. The
sexual sphere may also be excited by a stimulation of the gluteal region.
The practice of the Flagellants was suppressed by the church when it
was discovered that sensual motives played an important part in their
exercises. Rousseau in his confessions describes the pleasure he felt
when spanked by his nurse. Spanking often incites children to masturbation.
The main irritation of the genitals is induced by touch. Erection,
orgasm and ejaculation may be induced by the tactile irritation
of the penis in the man and of the clitoris in a virgin, and after defloration,
by the excitation of the anterior wall of the vagina. Certain
zones of the skin become secondarily related to sexuality, mostly at
such points where the skin turns into mucous membrane. These are
the erogenous zones.</p></div>

The word love is, as a rule, employed very loosely and made to
do duty for almost any attraction, whether purely physical or wholly
sentimental. Even great philosophers and distinguished writers do
rarely differentiate between animal passion and human love or between
pure sensuality or the somatic part of sex, and mental attraction or the
psychic phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
Plato says that love between a man and a woman is mere animal
passion, far inferior in nobility and importance to love for boys, friendship
or filial, parental or brotherly love. According to Plato, Socrates
understood nothing by love except its science, Ta Erotica. Eros Uranios
incites to love youths only, the more intelligent sex, and this only at a
time when their good character and high culture are beyond doubt.
</p>
<p>
Plutarch says: The passion for women causes at the best the gain
of sensual pleasure and the enjoyment of bodily beauty. The Greeks,
therefore, applied the celestial kind of love only to friendship and boy-love,
never to the love between men and women.
</p>
<p>
Sergi finds the cause of love in the stimuli of the reproductive
organs, and in the senses of touch and temperature.
</p>
<p>
Haeckel says: The oldest source of sexual love is found in the
erotic chemotropismus, in the attraction the male and female sexual
cells are exercising upon each other. This sexual affinity is found even
in the lowest stage of plants as in the protophyts, where both cells
swim toward each other to unite.
</p>
<p>
Rosenkranz finds in nature only an empire of love, of a love
that penetrates all things and leads them to a common end.
Gravitation is love dominating nature. Organic life is a continued phenomenon
of love. Even in inorganic nature the combination of substances,
one with the other, is a trait of love. The appearance of heat
and the flash of light that accompany the chemical process are, in a
manner, the heralds of lust felt by the substances while uniting. Love
of the sexes is a love for things that is ignored and unknown and
which is not yet even in existence. The lovers must perish that love
may continually rise to new life; the individual dies that the species
may live. Love is not the aim but the means, serving life and development.
</p>
<p>
Love is the joy at another’s existence and is stronger than the
delight at one’s own existence. Love transforms the nuptials into a
jubilee even where it is the eve of death. It is hence as strong as
death. There exists not only a natural love, but also a spiritual love
which is stronger than death. Natural love is not the true love, but
only a stepping-stone. True love is no longer blind and necessary, but
conscious and free.
</p>
<p>
Teichmüller says: In sensual love, Nature makes use of the individual
only incidentally, by making the propagation of the species a
personal concern of the individual. She gains her end by a mystification.
The individuals, by virtue of the innate impulse, consider the
external aim of nature as their own personal concern, for which they
voluntarily hazard everything, even life itself. Teichmüller further
claims that in physical love only the state of irritability and the sensibility
of the nerves of the subject are important. The object is only
concerned as a soliciting casualty. The natural impulse cannot aim at
lust, for lust is not an end, but only expresses the coördinate state of
the subject during the actions. Every desire aims at a specific action
as its end. The musician does not long for lust but for music. The
pleasure connected with it ensues coördinately with the success of the
performance.
</p>
<p>
Of sentimental love, Teichmüller says, the individual loves an ideal
which it has itself created in its thoughts and fancy and with which
the actual need not harmonize at all. For that reason the “treasure”
(in German the lovers call each other “Schatz” or treasure) lies not
without but within the lover. The beloved person outside is only the
key that understands to unlock the treasure. The key is not able
to create the wealth. Whoever is poor and desolate within, for him no
key can unlock the treasure of love.
</p>
<p>
Schopenhauer sees in amorousness an individualized sexual impulse.
The growing affection of the two lovers is, in reality, already the will
for life of the new individual, which they could and might beget.
The species has a prior, nearer and greater claim upon the individual
than the frail individuality itself. The exact destiny of the individuals
of the future generation is a much higher and worthier end than the
extravagant and transient bubbles of the enamored. The beauty or the
ugliness of the mate has nothing to do with the gratification itself, so
far as it is a sensual pleasure depending upon a pressing necessity of
the individual. Yet beauty is a matter of great consideration, because
it represents the will of the species. Every lover finds himself deceived
after the accomplished great work. For the delusion has vanished by
which the individual was deceived by the species.
</p>
<p>
In defining human love, Schopenhauer says that every individual
exercises a sexual attraction proportionate to the moral and physical
perfection it possesses which we attribute to the ideal of the human
species. The attraction of two individuals will be the more energetic the
more the deficiencies of the one will be counterbalanced by the virtues
of the other, and the union of the two promises a child more conforming
to the type of the species. Thus the greater the disparity the
stronger will be the attraction.
</p>
<p>
Danville, on the other hand, finds that alliances are more generally
concluded among individuals of the same education and of a
similar intellectual development. He, therefore, claims that love is the
most differentiated modality of the instinct of reproduction. Intellectual
development, education and culture, however, have carried it so far
away from its origin as to be entirely hidden.
</p>
<p>
Rousseau says: The physical desire is the one which drives one
sex to unite with the other. The moral one is that which determines
the desire and fixes it upon a single object exclusively, or at least gives
a greater degree of energy for this preferred object. Now it is easily
seen that the moral element in love is a factitious sentiment born of
the usage of society and glorified with assiduity and care by women to
establish their dominion.
</p>
<p>
Delboeuf looks for the basis of love in the chemical action by
which the female sex cells or ova exercise an attraction, magnetic in
nature, upon the spermatozoa, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Spinoza defines love as “laetitia concomitante idea externae causae,”
a pleasure accompanied by the thought of its external cause.
</p>
<p>
Bain finds the cause of love in the charm of dissimilarity.
</p>
<p>
Mantegazza defines love as a desire for a particular beauty.
</p>
<p>
Hartman says: Man is moved by instinct to look for an individual
of the other sex to satisfy his physical necessity, imagining that in this
way he will enjoy a pleasure he would look for in vain elsewhere.
This pleasure, one lover dreams to find in the arms of the other, is
only a delusion. Subconsciousness uses these deceiving means to oppose
the egotistic reflection and to dispose the individual to sacrifice its own
interest to the interest of the future generation.
</p>
<p>
Spencer says that the passions which unite the sexes are the
most complex and the most powerful of all feelings. Admiration, respect,
reverence, love of approbation, emotion of self-esteem, pleasure of
possession, love of freedom, love of sympathy, they all unite in the one
powerful feeling of love. They represent a variety of pleasurable ideas,
not in themselves amatory, but have an organized relation to the amatory
feelings. The complex sentiment, termed affection, can, therefore,
exist between those of the same sex, but it is greatly exalted in love.
</p>
<p>
Sidney declares love to be the most intense desire to enjoy beauty,
and where it is reciprocal, is the most entire and exact union of hearts.
The instinct, on the other hand, is absolutely sensual; it makes the exterior
its object and has no other end than sensual pleasure. Every individual,
therefore, loves more or less spiritually or sensually in proportion
as it approaches to the spiritual or bestial nature.
</p>
<p>
Hegel says: Love is the complete surrender of the “ego” to another
“ego” or to an ideal. Not the sacrifice of the possession or wealth of
the ego, but the “I” itself must be given away.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Janet declares love to be complete madness in its origin
as well as in its development and mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The same sentiment is expressed in a poem by Heine:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

This common every-day kind of love, which is nothing else but a
refined sexuality, pure and simple, has been elevated to a fetich by the
modern so-called intellectuals and extolled in and out of season. The
advocates of the new love-morality show by the attributes, as love at
first sight, that what they understand by love is sensual love. Yet
upon this prosaic attachment they try to build up their new system of
sexual ethics.
</p>
<p>
Every union not based upon this kind of sensual attachment is
decried as mere prostitution in marriage. Any marriage influenced by
such motives as loneliness, poverty, welfare of the nearest relatives, the
advance in social position, advance in business or in the professions,
without the obligatory romance, which after all is only refined animalism,
is considered contemptible. Such motives are held to be honorable
enough to govern any other action in the life of the individual,
but when it comes to marriage the line is drawn. Without the quickly
wearing off glamor of a silly moon-light romance, the best of motives
for contracting marriage relations are nowadays considered ulterior, and
the sought-for party regards itself as having married under a misapprehension.
</p>
<p>
Even eugenic power is attributed to this wonderful love. Two intellectual
and physical giants will beget weaklings, so we are told, if
their union has not preceded by love’s desire; while if two weaklings
marry upon short notice, guided only by their pent-up sex promptings,
the offspring, as a child of love, is prophesied to become a physical and
intellectual giant. As if the chromosomes, the carriers of the determiners
of the unit-characters, could be influenced by love’s perjuries.</p></div>

Thus capitalism has been evolved from primal communism, feudalism,
industrialism, capitalism; and we are gradually verging to state
socialism.
</p>
<p>
Marriage has been evolved from original permanent mating of the
prehuman state to primal promiscuity, consanguine family, punaluan
family, pairing family, patriarchal family, to strict female and loose
male monogamy, and is gradually reaching, through the modern feminine
movement, not, as some radicals seem to think, to variety, but to
strict male and female monogamy.
</p>
<p>
Through the entire range of higher animals, even among the
polygamous, the female is always monogamous, at least for the period
between one impregnation to the other. As soon as she has been impregnated
by one male, during the period of rut, she does not admit
any other male until the next period, and woman is no exception.
If she has the power she will force men to monogamy, but she will
never return herself to promiscuity.</p></div>

It is really amusing to notice how the radical writers put up a
target and fire at it to their heart’s content. They take the church or
state marriage and direct their poisoned arrows against it. As if the
biologist, when speaking of animal and human marriage, could ever
mean the conventional marriage. Neither does he understand by monogamy
the condition generally known by this term. The biological
monogamic marriage of a certain couple is their exclusive cohabitation
for a certain length of time. If during this time they refrain from
cohabitating with others they are for the time being living biologically
in monogamic marriage. The cock in the barn-yard is polygamous, the
steer in the herd is promiscuous, but the cow is monogamous. Once
she has been impregnated she will not admit any other male until the
end of the period of gestation and lactation, and the new period of
rut has set in. From the beginning of one impregnation to the beginning
of the other, almost a year, she is monogamic. This is the case
with almost all females among the higher animals, and woman does not
make any exception to this rule. Even the girl who professes free love,
except she be a nymphomaniac, would not continue to live with her
lover, if she found that while living with her he had had love affairs
with others. She would divorce him forthwith, and sometimes such a
divorce would be accompanied by quite a little scandal. Most of the
erotic murders committed by men upon women and most of the cases
of women throwing acid into the faces of men, we so often read in the
Parisian papers, are perpetrated by those whose marriage relations have
never been sanctioned by church or state. This fact reveals another
error of the radicals who picture the peaceful parting of their free-loving
couples in such glowing colors. They simply leave each other when
they do not love any longer. But in practice love does not depart from
both parties simultaneously, and the party which is still attached to the
other will resent the desertion no less than if they would have been
legally married. The reason is that normal men and women, except in
early youth, perhaps, are never varietists. The varietist who lacks the
instinct of exclusiveness is a psychopathic sensualist. No alienist could
have given a better description of the symptoms of the psychopathic sensualist
than that found in E. C. Walker’s (The moloch of the monogamic
ideal) picture of the sufferings of the varietist, not of the suffering of
total abstinence—in this case there may be some physiological basis—but
of the suffering for lack of variety. And those pathological specimens
are presented to us as normal men and women.</p></div>

The pride of the female, says Otto Weininger (Sex and Character,
p. 201), is something quite peculiar to herself, something foreign
even to the most handsome man, an obsession of her own body, a
pleasure which displays itself even in the least handsome girl, by admiring
herself in the mirror, by stroking herself and playing with her
own hair, but which comes to its full measure only in the effect that her
body has on man.</p></div>

Grudge, ill will, fear, hatred, or envy are often miscalled jealousy,
but are emotions entirely different from the emotion of sexual jealousy.
</p>
<p>
Jealousy is especially confused with the emotion of envy. Professional
jealousy, artistic jealousy, etc., for instance, are nothing but envy.
Jealousy has a real or pretended claim, envy has none. Envy needs only
two persons, jealousy three.
</p>
<p>
When a man, for instance, loves a woman in silence, without her
knowledge or encouragement, i. e., without even a pretended claim upon
her, and another man enters upon the stage, the emotion of the first
man is not that of jealousy but of fear, lest the second man may
succeed where he has not yet. When a man has a successful love affair,
and another man appears as a disturber, the emotion of the
second is that of envy. If the woman transfers her affections on the
disturber, the emotion of the lover is that of jealousy, because he had
a claim upon her.</p></div>

The experiments of Waldstein and Elder show that every congressio,
ending in the male ejaculation within the vagina, causes a certain
saturation of the female blood with a substance, owing its origin
within the male body, and exercises a certain change in the female blood.
These authors have shown by experiments on rabbits (Archiv für Kriminalanthropologie
und Kriminalistik, Vol. 56, p. 364) that the male
sperma within the female organism represents a foreign body in the
sense of Abderhalden. When the sperma has entered the blood of the
female organism it produces there a specific ferment. The blood of a
rabbit, twenty-four hours after copulation, possesses the quality of dialyzation
upon testicular tissue. This reaction is positive after every
copulation, no matter whether fertilization has taken place or not.
Thus a part of the male circulates within the blood of the female, even
after copulation without fertilization.</p></div>

Without this instinct, tumescence is impossible, and tumescence
must be obtained in men for erection and in women for orgasm, before
detumescence is possible. Hence coition must be in some slight degree
desired by the man, or it cannot take place at all. The potency of man’s
voluptas is, therefore, a condition sine qua non for copulation. Not so
in woman, she may submit without desire or excitement and allow
the man to enjoy complete satisfaction. But a man’s pleasurable excitement
is the necessary condition of woman’s sexual gratification.
The male potencies of voluptas and of erection are the conditions of
copulation even for the woman, but the reverse is not the case.</p></div>

These signs may easily be suppressed by the strong-willed wife,

continual sacrifice to his sensual desires and that she herself has no feeling
whatsoever during the act. By this trick she tries to rule him and
generally succeeds, especially when the husband is somewhat sensual by
nature. This stratagem is also responsible for men’s general belief
in women’s frigidity. In their youth men associate with venal women
who are naturally anaesthetic in their activities for hire. Later on

She is the one who does not care for the other sex at all. The patient
suffering from impotence of libido is not at all cold or frigid toward the
other sex. On the contrary, she is very passionate, but she has no use
for coition because it does not bring her satisfaction. She is only
anaesthetic for a certain kind of stimuli, i. e., coition.</p></div>

human emotion or its anomalies to sex. Thus not only cruelty connected
with sexual activity is termed sadism, but every kind of cruelty is imputed
to sadistic emotions. When the Spanish nations in Europe or
America love to see bull-fights and thus enjoy cruelty, inflicted upon
animals, these sex-determinists at once attribute this love of cruelty to
the sadistic nature of the Latin and his descendants. This averment
has as much right to make claim upon our credulity as the assertion
that when an infant falls back satisfied after nursing at its mother’s
breast, this satisfaction is of libidinous sexual nature. These singular
saints see sex everywhere, nothing but sex. No wonder that such claims
are repudiated by the logical mind. It is such exaggerations which
tend to bring the best teachings and theories into discredit.</p></div>

This Platonic explanation of homosexuality, attributing the
anomaly to the influence of a deity, is not quite modern, but it served
its purpose at that time. All the modern theories do not do any more.
For instance, the theory that men afflicted with an inverted sexual instinct
have a female brain and male sexual glands, “anima muliebris
in corpore virili inclusa,” is, as far as a theory goes, a good enough
working theory, but as far as a real explanation of the causes of the
homosexual anomaly is concerned, it does not contribute one iota (nor
does any other theory the author is acquainted with) to the etiology of
the abnormal emotion.
</p>
<p>
The reason is plain. We can never hope to find the cause of the
abnormal emotion before we have first gained absolute knowledge of the
nature of normal sex-attraction. Why does the Chilodon need conjugation
at definite periods? Why does it not go on dividing and multiplying
indefinitely without conjugation? The answer “protoplasmatic” hunger
or “erotic chemotropismus” (erotic chemotropismus is not always the
cause of sex-attraction; this clearly shows the infatuation, sometimes
met with, of a normal woman with a girl masquerading as a boy, where
no spermatozoa enter into the play; on the other hand, normally no
chemotropismus seems to exist between the ova and spermatozoa of
sister and brother who have been brought up together, while brother and
sister do sometimes fall in love with each other if they are ignorant
of their relationship) only begs the question. Whence comes this
protoplasmatic hunger, whence this erotic chemotropismus? Do these
beautiful high-sounding phrases say more than, e. g., a physician’s
diagnosis “colonic stasis,” when the patient complains of constipation.
Telling a homosexual man that he has a female brain is telling him what
he already knows.
</p>
<p>
The real etiology of homosexuality must remain unknown, until
we know the etiology of sex-attraction, and the knowledge of the
“whence” and “why” of sex-attraction is homoiousious, not to say
homoousious with the knowledge of the Supreme Cause. Sex-attraction
or love is an energizing power, akin to the other great forces of nature
or destiny, working to develop the soul of man, and it is futile to pick
out one attribute of the divine creative power and speculate over it
without the knowledge of the nature of the divinity itself. It is the
same mistake Job of old has made.
</p>
<p>
In this oldest Hebrew drama, the spectators or audience, at the two
scenes in Heaven, know that all the calamities, miseries and sufferings
of Job were inflicted upon the great sufferer, who represents mankind,
to try the constancy of his piety. According to human justice Job is
innocent. This is Job’s claim. His friends try to convince him that he
is not innocent, that even by the principles of human justice his sufferings
are not unmerited. But they are silenced by Job’s arguments.
Even the youthful Busite (Cap. xxxii.), emphasizing God’s greatness,
who must have discovered some hidden sin in Job, although he is not
answered by the latter, fails to convince us, for we know about the
stipulations between Jehova and Satan.
</p>
<p>
Then Jehova himself answers from the whirlwind. He does not
really answer, he rather asks some pertinent questions. “Have you been
present when the foundations of the Earth were laid, when the Stars
were born?” If not, how can he, the insignificant pigmy, dare question
divine justice. Since you, Job, have no idea of the nature of the divinity
(or God, the author fears to mention the word God lest he may offend
the delicate susceptibilities of his atheistic friends who fly into a rage
when seeing this word as a bull when seeing a red cloth), how can you
know the causes or reasons for his attributes? Divine justice is an
attribute of the divinity, and if the nature of the divinity is veiled in
mystery, divine justice must of necessity remain unknown to mortal
creatures, just as human justice is beyond the conception of the amoeba
or of the lion. Divine justice can not be compared at all with human
justice, just as the sense of justice of the amoeba or of the lion differs
from that of man.
</p>
<p>
Now, the same questions may still be asked to-day. We must still
recognize the incapacity of the human intellect to penetrate the divine
plan of the universe. With all our scientific attainments we still are in
ignorance about the sources of light. The length of its waves, its celerity
is known to science, but where does the Sun come from? When was he
born? Who gave birth to him? Science has traced the synthetic nature
of the plant, the analytic nature of the animal, but tell us, Job, whence
gets the seed the faculty to begin its synthetic work as soon as it is
placed in favorable soil?
</p>
<p>
Here we are silenced like Job of yore and refuse to answer. And
we are right. The “whence” and the “why” of things do not lie in the
realm of science. Science investigates the “how” and leaves the investigation
of the “whence” and the “why” to metaphysics or rather to
religion. Even the latter has not yet succeeded to give humanity the
irrefutable answer. From the Hindu trinity of Brahm’s Trimurti to
the Hebrew unity of Jehovah back to the Christian Logos of John, they
all tried to answer the question of the “whence” of things, and they
must have failed. Otherwise humanity of all climes and of all ages
would have had only one religion instead of being divided into innumerable
creeds.
</p>
<p>
As far as the “how” is concerned, such an explanation as “anima
muliebris in corpore virili inclusa” is quite a good enough working
theory. Inversion would thus be a degenerative phenomenon, the invert
representing the sport or the variation.</p></div>

Some of our hyperaesthetic sexologists, who see sex everywhere,
try to construe the friendship between David and Jonathan as homosexual
love. They find their inspiration in David’s lament over Jonathan:
“Thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.”
(II Samuel i, 26.) Whoever can see in this poetical expression homosexuality
has very little sense for poetry and a good deal for sex. The
Vulgata translates the verse: “Decore nimis et amabilis super amorem
mulierum,” and then adds: “Sicut mater unicum amat filium suum ita
ego te diligebam.” This word “diligebam” surely does not sound like
homosexuality. Nor does the word ἀγαπή used by the Septuaginta,
denote sex.</p></div>

The wail and cry of the patient that the common herd does not
understand him are well known. It is the old feminine protest that
men do not understand women. It is the familiar catch-phrase which a
flattering yellow journalism and mediocre literature are continually dishing
out to their women readers. Men will never understand women, is
preached in and out of season, insinuating a certain depth in and mystery
about her psyche. Most certainly, the man does not understand
woman’s psyche. He does not understand his own, neither does she
understand her own. The experiments in psychological laboratories are
dealing only with the relations between the sensations and perceptions,
not with the “whence,” “how” and the “why” of the mechanism of the
mind. The mechanism by which a material fluid, cell, or electron turns
into a thought, whether in the male or the female brain, is yet unknown,
neither is there any prospect that it ever will be. Still the
workings of the human mind are subject to observation, and we know by
experience that woman’s psyche changes with the change of her dress.
The mind of a man born in poverty and brought up in humble surroundings
will always remain humble, even when he becomes a millionaire.
He adapts himself with great difficulty to changed conditions.
Woman’s adaptation to new surroundings is phenomenal. Dress her as
a queen and she is a queen, clad in rags, she acts the beggar. Normal
men do not understand the nature of such a mind that can be so influenced
by outward appearance. Neither does man understand the wonderful
instinct of the hymenopter. Yet the insect seems to be less proud
of its mystery than our patient of his or the female of the species of hers.
</p>
<p>
For this very reason the male transvestites who are possessed with
a female spirit or a female soul are more interesting than the female
transvestite, possessed of a male soul. In normal men dressing is never
a matter of great concern, neither is it with the transvestite endowed
with a male mind. But the normal woman attributes a vast importance
to feminine dress, and the male transvestite with the female
soul excels her in dress-valuation.</p></div>

This is the psychological explanation for woman’s love of histrionic
spectacles. Almost two-thirds of all theatregoers are certainly
women. Still so much demi-nude femininity is presented on the stage,
presumably to amuse men and so few semi-nude men for the amusement
of women. Why do so many women run to the theatres to see the
nudity of their own sex? Men do not care for the sight of nude men?
The reason is that feminine nudity is presented on the stage not for
the amusement of the few men, but mostly for the amusement of the
great throng of women.
</p>
<p>
The female body has a sexually stimulating effect upon woman
(Colin Scott, Am. Jour. of Psych., Feb. 1895). The pride of the female,
says Weininger (Sex and Character, p. 201), is something quite peculiar
to herself, something foreign even to the most handsome man, an obsession
of her own body, a pleasure which displays itself even in the
least handsome girl, by admiring herself in the mirror, by stroking
herself and by playing with her own hair, but which comes to its full
measure only in the effect that her body has on man. Woman desires
to feel that she is admired physically. The normal woman regards her
body as made for the stimulation of the man’s sensations. This complex
emotion forms the initial stage of her own pleasure. The female body
has hence a greater exciting effect upon women than the male body has
upon men. Female nudity produces a greater impression upon her than
the male body ever does. Statues of female forms are more liable than
those of male forms to have a stimulating effect upon woman.
</p>
<p>
The same emotions are evoked in woman at the sight of female
clothes. Woman takes it for granted that her clothes, just as her
body, have an erotic effect upon the male. Hence female clothes awaken
in women a complex emotion akin to the sight of the female body.
Woman becomes sexually excited by her own clothes. For this reason
clothes are to woman of the greatest importance. The desire for beautiful
clothes is an irradiation of the sex instinct. The purpose of dress
is the attraction through covering. For the parts covered are rendered
more conspicuous.</p></div>

Such pamphlets as “What a young boy ought to know” or “What

and girls, if of the age to understand such pamphlets, do not need to
know anything, for the simple reason that they know everything, and in
a more prurient way than their elders. It is the height of absurdity to
give lectures on sex problems before classes in high schools or colleges,
where a large percentage of the boys have already passed through all
the stages of gonorrhoeal infection and a good many of the girls are
addicted to the practice of autoeroticism. After such habits have been
acquired, lectures will be of no avail. Nor are books, fit to be given into
the hands of boys or girls, of any value. By the time a child is able to
understand such books it knows more of sex than the book can teach.</p></div>

It is questionable if physicians always appreciate the dangers of

It is only the covering that gives to any part of the human

If the children have never been instructed before, and there is

either in the form of masturbation or in that of illicit venery, such
lessons are not only of no value, but they may even do more harm than

These phenomena during sleep are usually of a vague kind in young

To be sure this will mean preaching the morality of fear, and it
may be objected that “burglary is wrong, irrespective whether the
burglar does or does not get caught.” But the teaching of pure ethics is
best left to the minister, who is the natural teacher of morality. The
latter, with all the authority of religion, cannot prevent sex irregularities.
Rev. J. M. Wilson (Journ. of Education, 1881) says: “Emotional
religious appeals are far from rooting out sensuality and sometimes
even stimulate licentiousness.” This is a confession of the ministry
that, as far as chastity is concerned, pure ethics seem to have
been a complete failure. Hence, the pedagogue and physician will have
to give other, more appealing reasons for the avoidance of a promiscuous
life. Besides this, the morality of fear is a pretty good working
morality. The Bible (Exodus xx, 5 and 12, and xxii, 23, the observance of
a command carries its reward and the transgression of a prohibition
its punishment) often preaches the morality of fear, and upon the
Biblical morality all the western civilizations are founded. Morality is
the arrest of the instincts by the intellect, and the intellect always asks
for the ethical “why.” The instincts are the voices of the past generations,
reverberating like distant echoes in the cells of the nervous system.
To overcome this powerful inheritance, the intellect needs a sound, valid
reason, and the best reason will be, if we can show the violator of the
usages of society that he is not only injuring himself but that he does
harm to others. An immoral act must harm somebody. A man alone
in the world can not be immoral. If humanity suddenly perished, leaving
only one man on earth, there would be no morality left for him.
There is no moral precept which is not a social precept, no other duty
except toward one’s neighbor. If human sanitation and the universal
intelligent use of venereal prophylaxis could banish venereal diseases
from this planet, there would be no medical sex-problem, although
there might still remain some sex-problems for the sociologists to solve.
</p>
<p>
But venereal diseases are still here among us. If prostitution could
be expelled from our earth, the generations following such a happy
catastrophe would be free of venereal diseases. But as humanity seems
to be now constituted, we shall have to wait a long time for the
spontaneous disappearance of this plague. Even in the ideal state of
society, dreamt of by our economic determinists, prostitution will still
be in existence, as long as we continue to breed mental defects. Only a
very small percentage of prostitution is due to economic conditions. In
the great majority of cases it is absence of every moral principle and
will-power which determine the girls to embrace this unhappy profession.
Dr. Pauline Tarnowsky (Etudes anthropométriques sur les
voleuses et prostituées) found that professional prostitutes are imperfect
beings, affected by arrest of development, generally due to morbid
heredity, and present mental and physical signs of degeneracy in accord
with their imperfect evolution. They accept their abject trade agreeably
and do not want to change it. Laziness and absence of moral sense are
the principal traits characteristic of the prostitute. Dr. Olga Bridgman
(Jour. Amer. Med. Assoc., August 16, 1913) found among a hundred
and four sexually immoral girls, examined at admission at the State
training school for girls at Geneva, one hundred and one or ninety-seven
per cent. feeble-minded and only three normal. Dr. Edith E. Spaulding,
Physician, Massachusetts Reformatory for Women, Sherborn, Mass. (The
Amer. Social Hygiene Assoc. Bulletin, May, 1914), has completed a study
of the mental and physical factors in the cases of 244 girls leading a
life of prostitution. Of these over ninety-nine per cent. had one of the
venereal diseases, fifty per cent. had both syphilis and gonorrhoea. Of
the total number 60 per cent. showed syphilis and 89 per cent. gonorrhoea.
The mental and environmental factors disclosed by this investigation
are no less valuable and interesting. In only 15 per cent. did
environmental conditions alone seem to have determined the entrance
into a life of prostitution, the remaining eighty-five per cent. showed
some underlying mental or physical defect.
</p>
<p>
All these investigations tend to show that defective mentality is
responsible for the presence of prostitution. Prostitution, therefore, will
always be with us, as long as we allow mental defectives to propagate.
With the presence of prostitution, the venereal scourge will rage among
us, unless we can convince men to stay away from contamination.</p></div>

This course will mean a much larger task than merely lobbying
a bill through the legislature for the eradication of prostitution, the
common remedy of the reformer. It will come only by the slowest and
most difficult of processes and by that hardest of all work in the world,
i. e., thinking.
</p>
<p>
The off-hand reformers are too impatient with the slow and toilsome
process of competent and judicious sex-education. For them a law,
forbidding the marriage of the diseased, suffices to eradicate hereditary
syphilis and ophthalmia neonatorum. As a rule, their laws often intensify
the very ills they seek to cure. To the average reformer life is
presented in a stark and rigid outline. He has no perception of proportions,
no knowledge of values. Even when he acquiesce in the slow,
patient, laborious study of sex, he is blandly unconscious of distinctions.
He at once exaggerates matters. He can not see that the truth about
sex may be imparted to the child by parents, family physician or teacher,
but that it cannot be acquired by the child from the platform, stage,
novel or the ubiquitous magazine.</p></div>

case. The author was consulted by a young man, engaged to be

was whether he may marry the next month. He was warned against
marrying before repeated examinations have shown the absence of
gonococci. He then requested some drug for the prevention of another
infection. Now, if there ever was a man who had a reason to fear
infection, it surely was he. He suffered enough. Still he was ready
again to plunge into his promiscuous sex-life, without any thought of

no more knowledge of sex than what is known to every animal by
instinct. Pinard (Chronique Médicale, 1903, p. 488) says: “Jusqu’à
présent l’acte procréateur n’a été qu’un acte instinctif tel qu’il existait
à l’âge des cavernes, c’est le seul de nos instincts n’ayant pas été
civilisé. L’acte est accompli à l’aurore du XXe siècle comme à l’âge
de pierre.”</p></div>

What are a few generations in the history of humanity? One
to two centuries represent only a short space of time. Prostitution is
older than history. The Hammurabi codex, paragraph 100, has already
rules about Hierodules, or girls consecrated to the service of Venus.
Moses, Deuteronomy xxiii, 18, commands: “There shall be no temple
prostitute of the daughters of Israel.” Still prostitution existed among
the Jews as seen by I. Regum, xiv, 24; xv, 12; xxii, 46; II. Regum,
xxiii, 7; Amos, ii, 7; Hosea, iv, 14. At this point the prophet distinguishes
between the common and the temple prostitute. If such an
ancient institution could be banished from this earth by eugenics within
a few centuries, humanity could be satisfied.</p></div>

These conditions are now noticed even in our young country,
where not only the native of the Anglo-Saxon stock sets a limit to his
offspring but also the immigrant, who begins the same practices as soon
as he has reached a higher step of the social ladder. The same Russian
Jewess who in her native country set her pride to follow the religious
dictates of her race to increase and multiply, the same Italian or Irish
woman who in her native country would not have thought of defying
the tenets of the Catholic church regarding the limitation of offspring,
will ask her physician for some anti-conceptional remedy, as soon as
she has reached a certain degree of affluence. With wealth and power
come love for luxury and ease, and the consequence is the limitation
of the offspring.</p></div>

Any sex-order for breeding purposes must be a public institution,
and such an institution would be the worst slavery history has ever
seen. Mardach (The Tragedy of Man, twelfth scene) gives in his drama
a true picture of the tyranny of such institutions. The hero and
heroine of the drama are Adam and Eve, who are repeatedly reincarnated
at different important periods in the history of the world but do
not know who they are. At the different incarnations they always
happen to meet and fall in love with each other. The last reincarnation
on this earth takes place several thousand years after our present
era. At the end of the twelfth scene, Adam is present, when the old man
or judge of the town (called at that period Phalanster) disposes of
children and wives. Two women, one of them the reincarnated Eve,
arrive with their young children, and the judge, upon the advice of
the scientist, decides which trade they should learn.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Scientist! Examine the skulls of these two children.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Scientist.</span> This child should be brought up to be a physician, the
other to be a shepherd.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Out with them.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Eve.</span> Do not touch him! This is my child. Who dares to tear
him away from his mother-breast?
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Take him away! Why tarry with him any longer?
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Eve.</span> My child, my child! Did not I nourish thee with my heart-blood?
Where is the power that may rend this holy bond? Shall I disclaim
thee forever, that thou mayest be lost in the crowd, and my
searching eye, in restless fear, shall in vain look for thee among a hundred
similar phalanster-types?
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Adam.</span> O friend, if ought is sacred to you, leave this child to his
poor mother.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> You play, oh stranger, a daring game! If we allow the
revival of the conquered prejudice, formerly called the family, then the
acquisitions of our present science will tumble at once.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Eve.</span> What is to me your frozen science? May it fall, where
nature’s voice speaks.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Well! will it be done soon? (<i class="stage-direction">The child is carried away.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Eve.</span> My child, my child! (<i class="stage-direction">Eve faints.</i>)
</p>
<p>
SECOND SCENE
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> These two women are not mated yet. Those who wish
them for pairing come forward.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Adam.</span> Upon this woman make I claim.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Scientist! What is thy opinion?
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Scientist.</span> The man sentimental, the woman nervous, an unhealthy
issue would be the result. This pair fits not together.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Adam.</span> Still I shall not let her go, if she wishes me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Eve.</span> Magnanimous man, I am thine.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Adam.</span> I love thee, oh woman, with the whole fervor of my heart!
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Eve.</span> Also I, this I feel, will forever love thee.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Scientist.</span> Why, this is madness. Strange, indeed, to see reappear
the spirit of bygone ages in our enlightened world. How comes this?
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Adam.</span> It is a late ray of light from paradise.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> It is pitiable.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Adam.</span> Pity us not. This madness is ours. We surely envy not
you for your soberness. What in the world ever was great and noble
was such madness, which is not confined by circumspect anxiety. The
angel’s speech that sweetly sounds down to us from higher spheres is
a safer proof of our soul’s affinity and kinship to the higher regions.
We despise the low common dust of this earth, boldly searching the
road to the higher spheres. (<i class="stage-direction">He holds Eve in close embrace.</i>)
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Judge.</span> Why listen any longer to this nonsense. Away to the
hospital with both of them.
</p>
<p>
This poetical fancy gives, nevertheless, a true picture of the conditions
our descendants in future generations will have to contend with
if the patriarchal doctrines of our radical sociologists should ever
materialize. Their order of things must logically lead to the hardest
and most bewildering tyranny mankind has ever known. The tyrannical
Draconic laws will prescribe what to eat, what to drink, how
long to sleep, how to mate, and what the children should be.
</p>
<p>
This is not a fancy-dream. Even in our free country the drift of
the law-giving power is towards such conditions. In one State, it is
allowed to drink tea or coffee, but not alcohol, although ten grains
caffeine is already a deadly poison, but it will take many more grains
alcohol to kill. In another State it is allowed to smoke cigars but not
cigarettes, although of the three modes of using tobacco, snuffing, chewing
and smoking, the cigar is the worst of the last mode, because, as a
rule, it combines the effects of chewing and smoking. Another state
forbids marriage without a physician’s certificate, although, if the marriage
candidate wishes to conceal the truth, there is no physician living,
Neisser, the discoverer of the gonococcus, and Wassermann with his test,
included, who could tell with absolute certainty whether a man has
been infected or not. Even if the candidate himself, having been infected,
wishes to know whether he has been cured, the different tests are
of such an elaborate nature that very few physicians, even in the
metropolis, are able to make them. Still ignorance passes laws. Besides
this, no law, forbidding marriage, can prevent mating and the propagation
of the unfit. Even if the king, the representative of the law,
should imprison his young daughter in a brazen tower, her Jupiter will
find his way to her by a shower of gold.</p></div>

No doubt castration is a severe penalty for any human being.
But degeneracy itself is the penalty for the violation of biological laws,
and the eradication of degeneracy is no more than the satisfaction of
the law of talion and the restoration of the moral equilibrium. Society
has a right to make use of these measures of defense to free itself of
the degenerates, and nothing short than depriving them of the capability
of procreation will do the work.
</p>
<p>
This right does not mean that it is the duty of the State to make
search for inoffensive degenerates to satisfy the law of talion. In the
interest of personal liberty, it would be very dangerous to give society
the right to pick up inoffensive men and women on the streets, declare
them imbeciles and sterilize or castrate them. This would throw the
doors wide open to abuse. Only those who place themselves or are
placed under society’s protection, either in asylums or in prisons, and
have thus become society’s wards should be subjected to the rules and
regulations of society.</p></div>

The brutality of Nietzsche’s philosophy has never attracted normal
people, even if they had the assurance that the offspring of the
brutal mating will turn out to be supermen. This assurance can not
be given. The lessons of history teach just the contrary. The artificial
breeding of the Spartan warrior led to the sterility of every progress
of culture, science, art or commerce, while the chaotic panmixia of
Athens did not prevent this town of only thirty thousand inhabitants,
two-thirds of them slaves, to become the spiritual centre of Greece and
the teacher of untold future generations in art and science. But for
Athens and its panmixia, Sparta’s history would have remained unwritten
and its people buried in oblivion, like many another nation that is
known by name only. The most vaunted Spartan vigor has not left the
least sign of a monument, chiseled, written, carved, or stained, to record
Sparta’s very existence. Sparta’s vigor was the vigor of the bull or the
elephant.</p></div>

Hensen (Physiologie der Zeugung) concludes from statistics compiled

greatest number of conceptions follows the act practised in the days
immediately after menstruation. The chances of conception following
the act practised during menstruation are increased the nearer the
catamenial period is approaching its end. The number of conceptions
after the act practised before menstruation, Hensen found to be the

In a general way Hesiod advises never to practise concarnatio on
the return home from a funeral, but rather after having enjoyed a good
comedy, for the semen transfers cheerfulness as well as sorrow and other
affections to the offspring. For the same reason concubitus should be
avoided when in a state of intoxication. Diogenes said to a stupid boy:

Soranus goes so far as to claim that conception cannot ensue if
initus is not desired and longed for by the woman. Just as the man
can have no ejaculation, or rather erection, without desire, so is
conception impossible without it in the woman. Just as food, taken without
appetite or with disgust, will not be properly digested, so the sperma can
not be received by the womb, if inclination and lust are wanting during
concarnatio.
</p>
<p>
This opinion is not borne out by experience, for we find that pregnancy
does take place after concarnatio while the woman is in a
natural or hypnotic sleep, in a chloroformed state, in drunkenness and in
rape. These facts prove that pregnancy may follow concarnatio where
the woman did not experience the least degree of libido.
</p>
<p>
But even if conception be possible without libido, the lack of the
latter is a great impediment to impregnation.</p></div>

Roubaud says that, initus interruptus causes in the woman
voluptuous excitation without allowing the reception of the spermatic
fluid into the organs. The desire and the copulative-voluptuousness awaken
the sensibility of the womb and prepare it to receive the normal excitation
of the sperma. If its arrival fails, the uterine sensibility, awakened
by the erotic sensibility, reacts upon the mobility in a confused
manner and causes unsuitable and irregular motions. If these manoeuvres
are often repeated the woman eventually becomes a nervous
wreck.</p></div>

E. Kraus (Centralblatt f. Gynaecol., 1911, p. 747) found that all
chemicals which are recommended for the prevention of conception prove
themselves extremely unreliable in the practice. His experiments with
4 per cent. boric acid, 0.8 per cent. citric acid, etc., on hares and rabbits
failed entirely.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, namely, that there is no anti-conceptional device
in existence which affords real security against pregnancy, there arose
recently certain sociologists and physicians in Europe who demand the
abrogation of the laws contra abortionem.
</p>
<p>
The Pirogoff medical society in Russia demands the legalization
abortionis.
</p>
<p>
Hans Gross (Gross Archiv, Vol. 12, p. 345) says that in his opinion
the time is not far away when abortion will not be punished any longer.
</p>
<p>
Ed. v. Liszt (Die kriminelle Fruchtabtreibung, Zürich, 1910) says,
the punishment for committing abortion should only take place after
the pregnancy has advanced to a certain point. The possibility of recognizing
the human form or of distinguishing the sex of the embryo or
the capability of motion should mark the point in question. The moment,
after which abortion would be punished, would thus coincide with
the end of the second month.
</p>
<p>
Such proposals can only be made in countries where Roman law is
in force. From the point of view of the Roman law the embryo is “pars
viscerum mulieris.” Hence if she has a right to remove any part of
her body, she may also remove her embryo. No law denies a man his
right to have his healthy appendix removed even against the advice of
his surgeons, if he thinks it may bother him later on. Hence if the
woman thinks that carrying her embryo to term will subject her and
her child to great hardships, she has a right to have it removed.
</p>
<p>
But in our free country, under Anglo-Saxon law, nobody has a right
over his own body. Suicide is a crime. A woman has no right to remove
a part of her bowels. She and her body belong to the State.
</p>
<p>
For the same reason sterilization or castration for prevention of
conception must be considered criminal according to the philosophy of
our laws. The operation for the permanent destruction of the faculty
of propagation is nothing less than a partial homicide. For it destroys
the individual’s growth in the infinite. Hence the physician who performs
the operation of sterilization to prevent conception in a perfectly
healthy person is guilty of a crime, just as the homicide committed, in
the interest of euthanasia, upon the victim’s request, is a criminal offense.</p></div>

In their natural sexual life, men live at a loss, hence are more
katabolic, i. e., the changes in consequence of their sexual activity are
disruptive. Women, living at a profit, are more anabolic, i. e., the male

In a treatise on the science of sex-attraction, such as this, the
author is of the opinion, that the much-mooted question about the double
standard of sexual morality of the two sexes ought to be thoroughly
discussed.
</p>
<p>
In human affairs there is no effect without its adequate cause.
Codified law, custom and ethics, the three determiners and regulators
of human conduct, have all their reasons. If there is a double standard
of sex-morality there must be a reason for it. What is this reason?
Is this reason still extant? Is there still any justification for the
existence of the double moral standard? Have not any other reasons
arisen for a change of this double standard?
</p>
<p>
In modern times law and ethics do not know of any double standard
of sex-morality. In no civilized country do the laws punish any voluntary
sexual misconduct but adultery, and in the latter the prohibition
is for men and women alike. Ethics, on the other hand, allows sexual
relations in marriage only, and then mostly for the purpose of propagation.
Even such a radical as Zola says: “Si l’enfant n’est pas au
bout, l’amour n’est qu’une saleté inutile.” But as far as custom
is concerned there is no question of the existence of a double standard
of sex-morality. Even the most violent, rabid free-lover will resent
any allegations of a dissolute character in his mother, while he will
listen with perfect equanimity to narrations of the fast life of his
father. Whence comes this difference, which seems to be ingrained in
the heart of every man and woman? What is the cause of this phenomenon?
</p>
<p>
The answer that men with the power in their hands have sexually
enslaved womankind, shows not only ignorance of history and biology
(no species could survive for any length of time without the harmonious
coöperation of the two sexes. Where the female of the species is actually
kept subject to the male, where she is treated with cruelty by him,
or where the male neglects to protect and take loving care of the female,
the species has no survival power and dies), but also poor logic. If
the double standard of morality were not due to racial evolution, if it
could have been changed without hurting the race, sensual men would
have changed it long ago, because it is against these men’s interest to
have all women live in strict chastity. An unchaste man needs an unchaste
female partner. If all women—prostitutes included, sic!—were
chaste, where on earth could he get his partner? Hence the assertion,
frequently found, especially in feministic literature, that men-made laws
sexually enslaved women, is entirely illogical.
</p>
<p>
In fact, among the culture-nations laws against unchastity never
existed. Even the Bible has only laws against adultery. The adulteress
and her paramour were both stoned (Deuteron. xxii, 24), but the sexual
relations of the unmarried woman with any man were entirely ignored
by the law. Even rape was no criminal offense—the father of the girl
had only a civil action against the rapist (Deuteron. xxii, 28). Such
laws would just suit sensual men. It is in their interest that all
women except their own wives should lead dissolute lives. But it is in
the interest of the married woman, where adultery is prohibited, that
all other women should be strictly chaste, so that her husband would
be compelled to be faithful to her. Hence it is custom (and in
matters of custom woman rules supreme) that dictates chastity.
The punishment of a woman’s false step is social ostracism, decreed
by women themselves, not by men-made laws. The men-made
laws, on the contrary, strike men harder than women. The punishment
of the woman’s misconduct in marriage is loss of husband and children,
while the man loses wife and children and has to pay her alimony,
during her natural life, in the bargain. Yet the fallacy is repeated
again and again about men wishing to enslave their mothers, sisters,
wives and daughters.
</p>
<p>
But why does custom punish woman’s misconduct and why not
man’s? Why does the Biblical law discriminate between men and women
in regard to adultery? A married woman’s adultery is punished with
death, while the law is silent about the married man’s adultery with a
single woman. Why this discrimination that is as old as history? Was
there a justification for the double standard, and should not the twentieth
century change the double into a single standard? If changed,
should men become as chaste as women or should womankind be pulled
down into the gutter of sensuality to meet the demands of men?
</p>
<p>
The majority of mankind—women included—believes in the justification
of the double standard of sex-morality for the two sexes. Men
are thought to have greater erotic needs than women.
</p>
<p>
Recently there arose a new spirit in the domain of sex-morality
which demands a single standard for both sexes. The societies for moral
prophylaxis demand that men should become as chaste as women. In
this way the social evil and its satellites, the venereal diseases, would
disappear. On the other hand, the radicals have raised a unanimous
revolt against self-control in the domain of chastity for either sex.
These new moralists preach the right of men and women to the fulfillment
of every instinct, every impulse, every dream in all its fullness.
This is proclaimed as the new standard of sex-morality. But in truth
this subjugation of the individual to the instincts is a complete denial
of morality. For morality is the arrest of the instincts by the intellect.
</p>
<p>
In this part of our treatise the author will try to find the reason
for the double standard of sexual morality for the two sexes. Why
since the dawn of history the married woman was kept to a rigorous
chastity. How the chastity of the single woman has developed as a
corollary of the law of adultery, and he will thoroughly discuss the
reasons why the double standard of morality is at present utterly
without justification.</p></div>

Socialism applies the same tactics towards Christianity, as
Christianity used towards Judaism. Christianity borrowed Israel’s
greatest Book, the Bible, written from the first chapter of Genesis
to the last of Revelations, at different times in different languages, but
always by the sons of Israel, appropriated the moral tenets of these
Jewish prophets and rabbis (Jesus is often addressed by the title rabbi
in the New Testament) and repudiated the descendants of these Jewish
thinkers. Christianity, for generations, deprived these descendants of
the enjoyment of these human rights, their ancestors have woven for
mankind, and accused them of forming an element destructive of social
peace, in whose great Book social peace and justice were first preached.
The Hammurabi codex, which in regard to civil and criminal statutes
shows a certain parallelism with the Pentateuch, is far inferior to these
books in the multitude of social laws.</p></div>

If you meet with your neighbor on the sidewalk push him into
the middle of the road and let him be mangled by the passing vehicles.
Then you have made a long stride forward toward the perfect man.
If you do not do it to him he will do it to you. Only the stronger has
a right to survive, so that a perfect aristocracy may arise. But while
this doctrine of the survival of the strongest was with Nietzsche only
a philosophical dream, the prototype of the Superman, which is “Push
forward; overcome obstacles; take wherever you can find; grasp and
do not let go; live your own life fully, it is all you have; let others
look out for themselves,” has always been in existence since time immemorial.</p></div>

The spirit of this intoxication of work is shown in phrases such
as this: “Women deteriorated to the point where she was unfitted to
do a fair share of the world’s work.” Is work a privilege or a necessity?
Who is the power that has decreed this share of the world’s
work? Do animals in freedom work? By the way, the alleged deterioration
which presupposes a transmission from mother to daughter,
with the exclusion of her son, is a biological impossibility. If the
deterioration has become a unit-character, the mother must transmit
half of it to her son and half to her daughter, so that boy and girl
are still born equal. The only way such deterioration could be transmitted
from mother to daughter—who inherits half the good qualities
of her father to balance this deterioration—is that it has become a
sex-unit-character, like the female breasts, hair or skin, which is contrary
to all the teachings of biology. Even Lamarck would never claim
that such an acquired characteristic as deterioration for work could
be transmitted from mother to daughter with the exclusion of her son.
On the other hand, if deterioration is not a unit-character transmissible
to the son, it cannot be transmitted to the daughter either.</p></div>

The psychic bulwark, says Ch. v. Ehrenfels, against the horrors
of the thought of death and against the terrors of existence can only
be raised by man when he puts himself into a certain relation to the
metaphysical riddles of the universe, into a relation to the contrast between
the fleeting and eternal, between the movable and immovable, between
the finite and the infinite. The ethical values of individual conduct
may be thus characterized as those which are awakened in man,
when he places himself, with his wishes and actions, before the tribunal
of the eternal and inscrutable. Individual moral conduct, in contrast
to social morality which is determined by the moral imperative and
ethical relative values, is in this way regulated by the perennial threats
of the inevitable appearance of death.
</p>
<p>
To escape from this thought the morality of love recommends the
plunge into the whirl of sensual life. But at the approach of death
man sees that the transitory intoxication of the senses is also pure
vanity. For it is almost axiomatic among thinking men that the only
way to acquire the ability to look upon the terrors of existence and
the fleetingness of life with equanimity and consolation is to put their
labors in such a direction, where there is hope for the continuation of
their works beyond the individual existence far into the infinite, such
as the artist hopes of his art, the scientist of his science, and the
creative genius of his creation.</p></div>

Even Homer, the happy, life-enjoying Greek poet, expresses the
same pessimism (Iliad ix, 318).
</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">ἴση μοῖρα μένοντι καὶ εἰ μάλα τις πολεμίζοι</div>
  <div class="verse">ἐν δὲ ἰῇ τιμῇ ἠμὲν κακὸς ἠδὲ καὶ ἐσθλός</div>

“The same fate awaits him who remains home and him who risks
his life in the war for his country; in the same estimation are held
the coward and the brave. They both die in the same way, the idler
and he who has accomplished ever so much in life.”
</p>
<p>
The greatest rhapsody of pessimism is found in the Bible, in
Ecclesiastes. The quintessence of the royal preacher’s philosophy is,
“All is vanity.” “One generation passes away, the other comes, without
aim or end, purpose or intent.” Here is the sun, speeding through the
heavens, for which purpose or intent?
</p>
<p>
“The sun riseth and the sun sets and hasteth to the same place,
where it rose”; without aim or end. Here is the wind blowing furiously
a gale, to which purpose or intent?
</p>
<p>
“The wind goes to the south and turns to the north, it whirls about
continually and returns again according to his circuit,” without aim
or end. Here is the river, the torrent rushing down a precipice,
to which purpose or intent? “All the rivers run into the sea, yet the
sea is not full, unto the place from whence the rivers came, thither they
return again”; without aim or end. All things turn in a circuit without
aim or end, purpose or intent. All is vanity and vexation of the spirit.
</p>
<p>
“What happens to the fool, so it happens to the wise. There is
no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever. How dieth
the wise man? As the fool. In the days to come shall all be forgotten”
(ii, 15, 16).
</p>
<p>
Then the preacher turned, in search for a definite purpose in life,
to different philosophies of human conduct, he becomes in turn a work-worshipper,
love-worshipper, pleasure-worshipper; and what did he find?
“There is nothing good in the things God has created but for a man
to rejoice” (iii, 12). Thus it appears to him that the philosophy of
pleasure is the only purpose in life. But a little later he finds that
also this philosophy is of no profit. “But a man has no preeminence
above the beast; for all is vanity” (iii, 19).
</p>
<p>
Then comes a passage which shows how pessimism blinds the keenest
observer. “There is one alone, he has neither child nor brother, yet
is there no end of all his labor, neither is his eye satisfied with riches,
neither says he, for whom do I labor? This also is vanity” (iv, 8).
</p>
<p>
Now, this fact of the lonely man working for the future without
apparent purpose, ought to have given the philosopher a hint, that
there must be something behind this will to labor without aim or end.
“Arbores serit agricola quarum fructibus nunquam fruetur.” But pessimist
as our philosopher is, he returns to his philosophy. “This also
is vanity.”</p></div>

Jagadis Chandra Bose (The Modern Review, Calcutta, 1914)
succeeded in establishing the perfect parallelism between animal and
plant. He found that all plants are sensitive and that in certain of
them are tissues which beat spontaneously like the heart-beat of the
animal. Response to electric stimulus, too, is identical in the plant and
in the animal. In short, the life of the plant is the life of the animal
in almost all its incidents, only in less degree.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_DQ_121" href="#FNanchor_DQ_121" class="label">DQ</a>
In nature the individual counts for nothing, the race for everything.
Nature is pitiless in the destruction of individuals. Thousands
of animal lives are consumed to feed one lion throughout its life, millions
of plant lives to feed one ox. In nature the individual is as
ruthlessly sacrificed as in war. In this respect war is more in harmony
with the designs of nature than peace.
</p>
<p>
In peace all the manifestations of life are individualistic. Eating,
drinking, sleeping, and amusing one’s self are all actions in the interest
of the preservation of the individual. Even the impulse of the preservation
of the kind, or of propagation, is in the last analysis individualistic
in nature. It is the aspiration to save at least one part of the
individual from general annihilation. The child is the part of the
parents which survives after the parents’ death. All the activities of
man, even the noblest, partake of a certain egoistic element. The
mother in sacrificing her life to save her child is unconsciously merely
sacrificing the older part in order to save the younger part, of herself.
But when the very existence of the individual is in jeopardy, when life
itself is at stake, then all ideals centering in altruism are cast aside,
and the Satanic cynic grins, muttering the Biblical verses:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</div>
  <div class="verse">“But put forth thine hand, and touch his bone and his flesh,</div>
  <div class="verse">“And he will curse thee to thy face.” (Job ii, 4-5.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>
But all egoistic tendencies are silent in war. Here the individual
is merely an insignificant little wheel in the huge war-machine. Here
the individual counts for nothing, the nation for everything, the individual
must perish that the nation may flourish ever after. Now, what
is the modern nation, but an idea, what is the monarch in western countries
or the flag, but a symbol? Men live as happy, as content, as free
in London, Brussels, Paris, or Berlin. Ostend, e. g., would not materially
change its mode of life, whether it is Belgian, French, British, or German.
(The semi-Asiatic Russia naturally forms an exception. Anyone
who has lived near the German-Russian frontier and has observed the
sunny German village with its clean paved streets, lined with pretty
large-windowed brick houses, all supplied with the modern urban comforts,
where tidiness and cleanliness, light and well-being, happiness and
prosperity dwell; and compared with this sunshine, only a hundred yards
away, on the Russian side, has seen the dirty, streetless Russian village,
with its windowless, straw-roofed, low, wooden shanties where man
and beast live under one roof in squalor, filth, poverty and misery—and
here it is where real civilization reveals itself, not in the borrowed,
French mannerism in the palace of Petrograd—will not doubt for one
moment that there is a vast difference between the life under a semi-Asiatic
civilization and that under western civilizations. At this corner
of the world, war is utilitarian as among the barbarians in ancient
times. Here the Teutonic civilization is in war against the slavery of
the knout.) But what are the western nations fighting for? They are
fighting for an ideal; here men give their lives for a symbol.
</p>
<p>
Herein lies the chief service of war. (War is also calling out men’s
higher virtues, such as love and devotion to the fatherland, sympathy
with one’s compatriots, display of sacrifice, return to simple life, etc.)
It is the creator of the highest idealism, which is capable of the supreme
sacrifice, life itself. Such high idealism is found only among the warlike
nations of the world throughout human history. These same warlike
nations, the Hebrews (the Bible is replete of war-narratives), the Greeks,
the Romans and the Teutons, have also built up the higher civilizations.
Only those absorbed in the category of the ideal, in the enthusiasm of
humanity, can be seized by the great ecstatic impulsion to war. The vulgar,
the ignorant, the selfish, engrossed in their own small affairs and engulfed
in the mire of utilitarianism, for whom the only meaning, worth
and work of life is barter, have no conception of the highest sacrifice,
which is life, and can not comprehend the meaning of war, nor do they
ever contribute to the ideal edifice of a higher civilization.</p></div>

The author will follow here the discoveries of Morgan as described
in his “Ancient Society.”
</p>
<p>
Morgan divides the human history into three periods—savagery,
barbarism and civilization. He then subdivides the first two epochs into
three stages each.
</p>
<p>
In the lower stage of savagery man lived on trees and in caves.
His food consisted of fruits, thus being compelled to live in warm
climates where his food was always to be had. In this stage men
lived in a kind of monogamy.
</p>
<p>
The middle stage of savagery begins with the discovery of fire.
Fish was added to man’s food. In this way men were able to move in
hordes in colder climates.
</p>
<p>
The upper stage of savagery dates back from the invention of the
bow wherewith man could hunt his prey.
</p>
<p>
The lower stage of barbarism begins with introduction of pottery,
the middle stage with the introduction of agriculture and the
upper stage with the discovery of metals. The last is the stage wherein
the Homeric Greeks live.
</p>
<p>
Simultaneously with humanity’s advance from the lower to the
higher stages, the relations of the sexes also changed.</p></div>

Punalua is an Indian word for uncle. In this family the children
do not know their father, but they know the brother of their mother.
The uncle is thus the relative who looks after the special interests
of his sister’s children within the clan.</p></div>

Many scholars differentiate between endogamous and exogamous
tribes. But Morgan has shown that Endogamy and Exogamy are only
two different stages, that in the course of evolution every human tribe
has passed through the endogamous and exogamous stages. The Bible
knows yet the exogamous stage. “Therefore, shall a man leave his
father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife” (Genesis ii, 24). This
shows that exogamy lasted into the stage of the pairing family. In
the patriarchic family of the Bible, it is the woman who leaves her
clan and joins that of her husband. The same is the case among the
Homeric Greeks (Ilias vi, 29).</p></div>

“It is, indeed,” says Hartmann, “her own bed which the immoral
wife besmirches. While the husband misconducts himself outside the
family circle, the iniquity of the woman is bound to effect a change
in the home.”
</p>
<p>
Even the unchastity of the single woman has far more serious
biological consequences than that of the man. Her transgression creates
a perfect blood chaos in her future offspring. Long after a man’s
death a woman sometimes bears children to another man, who resemble
the first. The absorbed sperma seems to leave an indelible impression
upon the woman.</p></div>

The masculine morality is as yet very little influenced by reason.
Hence the male standard of morality of sex is as yet very low. So much
so that with meretricious venery rampant, male monogamy is as yet
a dream of the idealist. Yet there is a valid reason why the man
should not be inferior to woman in the standard of chastity. If
there was no racial reason for his chastity in ancient times, there is
a good reason for him to be chaste now.</p></div>

Feminine modesty and coyness have become real instinctive

The radical preachers of revolt against chastity are fond to assert
that chastity has been forced upon women by men. This assertion
does not betray profound logic. The entire institution of monogamy,
or of marriage for that matter, is in the interest of woman and eminently
adapted to her needs only. Woman’s greatest need is to love and
to be loved, a man can more readily sublimate his sexual instinct into
higher channels.
</p>
<p>
The same shallowness of observation is shown in catch-phrases,
such as this: “Once women married because they were not permitted
to work at all, now they marry because they are forced to work beyond
their endurance.” And why do men marry? Not for the satisfaction
of their sexual desires; this they can have without the valuable
privilege of being allowed to support some other men’s daughters. No,
men and women marry because, if they are not degenerates, they
are driven to marriage by the permanent mating instinct, which is
innate in man for the benefit of the offspring.</p></div>

Noeggerat claims that, in the city of New York, of 1000 married
men 800 have had gonorrhoea, 90 per cent. of all these have not been
healed and can infect their wives. As a result, at least three out of every
five married women in New York have gonorrhoea as a gift of their
husbands.
</p>
<p>
These statistics may be somewhat exaggerated, still the percentage
of diseased young men is appalling. At least 50 per cent. of young men
approaching the age of maturity become infected with venereal diseases
in a single year.
</p>
<p>
Kirchner, of the Prussian ministerium of cultus, claims that about
one hundred thousand men suffer daily of venereal diseases within the
Prussian monarchy. The result is a loss of a daily income of at least
250,000 marks, or a loss of 90,000,000 marks a year.
</p>
<p>
Rogers claims that over ninety per cent. of our young men stray
from the paths of virtue before marriage; sixty per cent. contract
venereal diseases which are difficult to cure. More wives than prostitutes
have venereal diseases, innocently contracted from husbands.
Thousands of unborn babies are annually killed by parental infection.
Sixty per cent. of the blindness in this country is due to venereal diseases.
One-eighth of all cases in New York hospitals are venereal. Two
hundred thousand infected persons walk the streets of New York daily.

urinating, noticing at the same time a certain leucorrhoea, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, it is caused by the gonococcus. If two
weeks after she was married, she feels pain in her lower abdomen, the
case is suspicious of gonorrhoeal salpingitis. The gonorrhoeal infection
reaches the tubes about ten to fourteen days after the initial infection
of the cervix. The vagina may not be affected at all. Gonorrhoeal
vaginitis is exceedingly rare. The pavement epithelium, covering the
vaginal surface, seems to afford protection against the specific infection.
Gonorrhoeal endometritis is also rare. Gonorrhoea infects the female
genital tract by jumps. From the urethra and vulva the infection
jumps to the cervix and hence to the tubes and ovaries.</p></div>

According to Neisser there are in Germany thirty thousand blind
persons whose loss of sight may be thus accounted for.</p></div>

These gonorrhoeal complications may serve as a deterrent for the
individual but would have nothing to do with morality, if they would
not also be met with in the innocent party. If gonorrhoea and its
complications would only affect the individual that voluntarily exposes
itself to infection, it would be of no more moral concern than measles
or pneumonia. But gonorrhoea insidiously strikes the innocent women
and children. Hence it is subject to the “moral imperative,” “Thou
shalt not kill, blind or maim your wife and child.” To give such a
loathsome disease to another person is hence a moral crime, apart from
the fact that the misconduct of the unchaste man is to the detriment of
himself and of the race and is immoral. Still writers who call themselves
independent thinkers demand yet better proofs of the immorality
of man’s unchastity.
</p>
<p>
The only excuse for the men who carry gonorrhoea into their families
is that they do not know the consequences. As a rule, the misfortune
comes upon the family quite unaware. The man cannot even
be blamed of negligence. Not only the woman acquires gonorrhoea
without her knowledge and in absence of all local or general symptoms,
but even the man does not know that he is still harboring infectious
material in his genital tract.
</p>
<p>
Prof. Bum has found gonococci in the urine and in the urethral
secretions, five and ten years after the onset of the infection. At such a
late period no man ever thinks of still being infectious, and in this way
he becomes not infrequently unaware the murderer of his mate.</p></div>

The prevalence of syphilis is estimated at 18 per cent. of the
adult population. Ruggles found in New York City, in the better class
of families, one-third of the sons of adult age to be infected with
syphilis. Syphilis causes about forty per cent. of all miscarriages.
The mortality of syphilitic children is about sixty per cent. Syphilis
is the only disease transmitted to the offspring in full virulence. Sixty
to eighty per cent. of all infected children die before they are born, or
come into the world with the mark of death upon them. The mortality
of the children who have inherited syphilis from the father is about
twenty-eight per cent., of those who have inherited it from the mother
is over sixty per cent. A large number of those who survive childhood
dies from hereditary syphilis between the ages of ten and twenty.</p></div>

Among the European working-classes and peasants, according to
Ellen Key, the free union of love has long been the custom. This
premature sexual life contributes to hinder the full bodily and mental
development of the lower classes.</p></div>

All ethical possessions in the inner man, his modesty, morality,
his divine adoration, his aesthetic and his social service are all due to
the repression of sexuality.</p></div>

Pflüger (In Jacobsohn’s Article, St. Petersburg Med. Wochenschr.,
1907, p. 97) says: If all the authorities of the world should
proclaim the innocuousness of continence, it would have no influence upon
youth, for forces are here active which will break every obstacle.
</p>
<p>
Thus even Pflüger admits that continence is compatible with perfect
health and only thinks that the force of sensuality would sweep
aside all recommendations of abstinence. Now, about the possibility
of total abstinence, there may be a great difference of opinion. But
granted absolute abstinence is only an ideal, no ideal can be realized,
otherwise it would not be an ideal. We can only approach an ideal,
and this would be a great gain in regard to sexual continence. Näcke
says that absolute sexual abstinence is an utopia just as the total abolition
of prostitution, public and clandestine, or the absolute abstinence
from alcohol. Man’s impulses are too powerful, but they may be restrained
and kept in proper bounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_EN_144" href="#FNanchor_EN_144" class="label">EN</a>
Statistics show that it is not at all the question about the men
being continent, but about the boy controlling early passions. Most men
contract venereal diseases between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five. The
mature man is always able to control his passions. The more healthy,
says Chassaignac, and the nearer the normal an individual is, the better
he can not only control his passions, but the less is his condition
likely to be disturbed by continence. It is the neurasthenic who is most
prone to be upset by an attempted or enforced continence and who, as
well, is most given to excess.</p></div>

The Talmudists, the keenest observers of human life and conduct,
knew this when they said אבר קטן יש באדם משביעו רעב ומרעיבו שבע
(Sanhedrin, p. 107A). “There is a small organ in the body of a man
which is always hungry if one is trying to satisfy it, and is always
satisfied if one starves it.”</p></div>

The family, i. e., near their father and mother, is the only institution
where children were meant to be brought up. No collective work,
settlements, vacation homes or asylums can protect or guide friendless
children properly. The spiritual and emotional education of the child,
the awakening of its higher sentiments can only be carried out in the
atmosphere of the parental home, under the guidance of love and affection
of those who have given life to this child.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_EQ_147" href="#FNanchor_EQ_147" class="label">EQ</a>
Since men’s deviation from the strict path of chastity jeopardizes
the very existence of the race, sexual morality must be binding upon
all men, under all conditions without any regard to the original reason
for the establishment of the moral law. A law, in its nature, can not
acknowledge any exceptions. There may be a case where infection
could be excluded with absolute certainty, just as there may be a case
where the father’s doubt would have no consequences for the child.
Embezzlement is also sometimes allowed and even a duty, as Cicero
shows in “De Officiis,” “Si gladium quis apud te sana mente deposuerit,
repetat insaniens, reddere peccatum sit officium non reddere.” In a
remote future, under communism, as Mardach paints it, all the reasons
for male or female sexual morality may become non-existent. Then the
standard will surely change. But in our present state of society one
standard of morality must be established for men and women, from
which no one should have a right to deviate, no matter even if the
reasons for the standard are not applicable in the particular case.</p></div>

The imperious instinct which decrees the perpetuation of the
race, says Lewis, can be controlled and directed aright by the consistent
knowledge of truth. When the young man has been taught the dignity
of virility, when he has learned that purity is conducive to bodily development,
while vice carries with it the most serious diseases in its
train and the danger not only of ruining his own life but also the
health of his future bride and the entire progeny, he will not stoop to
vice for the gratification of his desires. The average man is not a
criminal, he does not wreck the life and health of his wife and children
knowingly and wilfully. In most cases he does it through ignorance of
the nature and terrible consequences of the disease.</p></div>

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
